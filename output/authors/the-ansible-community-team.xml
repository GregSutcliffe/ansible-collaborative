&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ansible contributor summit logo" src="https://ansible.com/images/posts/archive/contributor_summit_202310-durham.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ansible Contributor Summit is a full day working session for
community contributors to interact with one another and meet with the
Ansible development teams behind the projects like AWX, Galaxy NG,
Molecule, Ansible Lint and Event-Driven Ansible. We will discuss
important issues affecting the Ansible Community and help shape the
future of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to have the opportunity to do a second Contributor Summit
this year, and this time it will be part of DjangoCon US 2023 in Durham,
NC. Our previous experience co-locating the Contributor Summit with
another related event was in February in Ghent, Belgium as part of
CfgMgmtCamp 2023. It was so successful, we wanted to do it again with
another great match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hello, Durham!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be meeting in the "Bull City", the home of Ansible itself and
the inspiration for our beloved mascot, Ansibull. In case you didn't
know, the Ansible office overlooks the Durham Bulls Athletic Park, and
this mixed with Ansible word play is why you might see mentions of bulls
and Ansibulls in Ansible land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't attend the event in person in Durham, worry not! Ansible
Contributor Summit is a hybrid event, so you will be able to join
online. Details will follow later on how to do it, but we will have both
streaming for the presentations and communication channels to
participate in the hackathons or sprints. Check how to register for the
online event below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make the Contributor Summit yours&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; like to hear about at the Ansible Contributor Summit?
Are there topics you'd like to discuss or parts of the project you'd
like to hack on? Propose your ideas
&lt;a href="https://forum.ansible.com/t/ansible-contributor-summit-durham-2023/28"&gt;in the following topic&lt;/a&gt;
in the new Ansible Community Forum. Please do it by Friday, October 6,
so we can prepare the agenda for the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name of the speaker/facilitator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details or abstract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type: Presentation, Discussion, Hacking or Other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimated duration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to have a presentation or slides ready at submission
time. If you have an idea, propose it! We would love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to attend: Register now, it's free!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ansible Contributor Summit will be part of DjangoCon US 2023&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this new edition we are joining forces with DjangoCon US, so you can
expect some extra discussions and topics around Python and Django in the
Ansible projects. If you are interested in contributing to AWX (upstream
of automation controller, formerly Red Hat Ansible Tower) or Galaxy NG
(upstream of Ansible automation hub), this might be a great
opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Ansible community events, we adhere to the &lt;a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html"&gt;Ansible Community Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ansible.com/blog/ansible-contributor-summit-durham-2023/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Welcome to the new Ansible Community Forum</title><link>https://ansible.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-ansible-community-forum/</link><dc:creator>The Ansible Community Team</dc:creator><description>&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to the new Ansible Community Forum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we're delighted to announce the launch of the new
&lt;a href="https://forum.ansible.com/"&gt;Ansible Community Forum&lt;/a&gt; - a single starting point
for questions and help, development discussions, events, and much more.
Everyone is invited, whether you are an Ansible user, contributor or
developer, we are all community! &lt;a href="https://forum.ansible.com/signup?"&gt;Register here to join us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hello Discourse!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a screenshot of the forum's main page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot" src="https://ansible.com/images/posts/archive/forum-main-page-screenshot.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are familiar with forums, we hope you'll feel right at
home. For those who may be new, please don't worry! We have a list of
&lt;a href="https://forum.ansible.com/tag/forum-tips"&gt;tips &amp;amp; tricks here&lt;/a&gt;, and
you're always welcome to check the guides and post in the
&lt;a href="https://forum.ansible.com/c/forum-guide-feedback/"&gt;feedback section&lt;/a&gt; to help us
shape our online community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forums are only successful if they are used. To make that happen, the
Ansible Community Team is looking to make this the real home of the
Ansible Community - a place for users to &lt;a href="https://forum.ansible.com/c/help/6"&gt;get help&lt;/a&gt;,
to &lt;a href="https://forum.ansible.com/c/events/8"&gt;find an event or local meetup&lt;/a&gt;,
and a jumping-off point for &lt;a href="https://forum.ansible.com/c/project/7"&gt;development and contribution discussions&lt;/a&gt;.
That means we need &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; to come and participate! Tell us what you're up to, post your
thoughts or your questions, sign up for an event or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ansible Community is global, and we are proud to include a section
in the forum aimed at supporting our &lt;a href="https://forum.ansible.com/c/other-languages/10"&gt;international communities&lt;/a&gt;
who would like to have a space where they can write in their own language. If you
speak any languages other than English, you are welcome to join and
collaborate in your own language. We think this section will be
particularly useful for those who do local meetups, so if you are part
of one, please make use of it to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new community space is based on &lt;a href="http://discourse.org/"&gt;Discourse&lt;/a&gt;,
which is fast becoming the industry standard for web forums - you need
only look to Python, Kubernetes, Fedora, and other open source
communities. It's powerful enough to meet our needs, flexible enough to
deal with the wider variety of projects and teams we have, has solid
accessibility and translations, works well on mobile devices, and (if
you prefer) can be interacted with by email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dive In!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We in the Ansible Community Team are very excited about this, and we hope you are too.
So &lt;a href="https://forum.ansible.com/signup?"&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt;, head to this post to &lt;a href="https://forum.ansible.com/t/introduce-yourself/15/25"&gt;introduce yourself&lt;/a&gt; and tell us your thoughts. See you there! &lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ansible.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-ansible-community-forum/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ansible Community Day, Berlin 2023</title><link>https://ansible.com/blog/ansible-community-day-berlin-2023/</link><dc:creator>The Ansible Community Team</dc:creator><description>&lt;h2&gt;Ansible Community Day, Berlin 2023&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ansible community day logo" src="https://ansible.com/images/posts/archive/community-day-berliin-20230824.png"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ansible Community Day is a new initiative by the Ansible Community
Team at Red Hat to connect with the people using, contributing to, and
developing the Ansible project worldwide. This new event complements the
Ansible Contributor Summit, to put the users of Ansible in all their
shapes and forms front and center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last Ansible Community Day in Boston, the day right before
AnsibleFest 2023, the community had the opportunity to meet in-person
and get to know each other, learn a few things and share their knowledge
using Ansible. It was such a great experience that we couldn't wait to
have another. And here it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Guten Tag Berlin!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two very successful Ansible Community Day events this year, the
first in Pune, India in February and the next in Boston in May, our
third event for 2023 will be held in Berlin, Germany!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration for Ansible Community Day Berlin 2023 is now open! If you'd
like to attend, please check out the following
&lt;a href="https://ansible-community-day-berlin-2023.eventbrite.com/"&gt;Eventbrite page for specific details and registration.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is set for Wednesday, September 20, 2023.
We will meet in c-base (Rungestraße 20, Berlin, Germany)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you expect from (or bring to!) the upcoming Ansible Community Day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ansible community recap of previous announcements, status and
    what's new!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User stories: Sharing of achievements and challenges using Ansible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live (and recorded) demos: It's showtime! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ansible Content Collections: how to create, contribute or use them
    to automate everything!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better together: Integrating Ansible with other tools or platforms
    (e.g. Kubernetes, Terraform, Dynatrace, Grafana, Jenkins, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn about the Ansible ecosystem (e.g. AWX, devtools, Event-Driven
    Ansible) and how you can contribute to these open source projects to
    jumpstart your career&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And last but not least: community networking!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of those above caught your attention and you are thinking "I
could talk about that", check the &lt;strong&gt;Call for Proposals&lt;/strong&gt; below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Call for Proposals (CFP)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for speakers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have something to share with the Ansible community of users and
contributors, you can &lt;a href="https://www.papercall.io/ansible-community-day-berlin-2023"&gt;submit your proposal&lt;/a&gt;
before September 4 at 23:59 (UTC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presentations don't need to be ready upon submission, we are only
requesting a title and abstract at this time. Any of the topics above
are valid submissions, but that's not an exhaustive list. Feel free to
submit any idea or proposal involving Ansible, and we will let you know
if it works for the current event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have questions? Doubts? You can reach out to us in our &lt;a href="https://matrix.to/#/#social:ansible.com"&gt;Social Room&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;code&gt;#social:ansible.com&lt;/code&gt;) in the Ansible Matrix space or email the Ansible Community Team at
&lt;a href="mailto:ansible-community@redhat.com"&gt;ansible-community@redhat.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Ansible community events, we adhere to the &lt;a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html"&gt;Ansible Community Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ansible.com/blog/ansible-community-day-berlin-2023/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ansible Community Steering Committee</title><link>https://ansible.com/blog/ansible-community-steering-committee/</link><dc:creator>The Ansible Community Team</dc:creator><description>&lt;h2&gt;Ansible Community Steering Committee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all know, Ansible is a well-adapted tool for the end-to-end
automation of IT infrastructures. At the same time, due to the addition
of new features and developments within the project, the Ansible
community is growing at an accelerated rate. To help structure the
project and also to facilitate the change in direction, we are launching
a &lt;strong&gt;Steering Committee&lt;/strong&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;Ansible Community Project&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Steering Committee's role is to provide guidance, suggestions, and
ensure delivery of the Ansible Community package. The committee shall be
broadly representative of the planning and approval areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial Steering Committee members, selected based on their wide
knowledge of and active contributions to the Ansible project, are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toshio Kuratomi (abadger1999)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Felix Fontein (felixfontein)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tadej Borovšak (tadeboro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James Cassell (cyberpear)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Barker (gundalow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew Klychkov (andersson007_)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alicia Cozine (acozine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorin Sbarnea (zbr)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jill Rouleau (jillr)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brad Thornton (cidrblock)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dylan Silva (thaumos)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the committee will work with community users plus Ansible
teams within Red Hat to assist in the composition of idea proposals/new
collection inclusion requests. Rather than advocating on behalf of
particular interests or perspectives, the job of the Steering Committee
members is to listen carefully to their fellow community members,
discuss, train, guide, and help them shape the Ansible Upstream Project
in the best possible direction for the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the current responsibilities of Ansible Community Steering
Committee members:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design policies and procedures for the collection world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review content (collections for now) for compliance with the
    policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help create the community deliverables (community.general
    collection, community.network collection, the ansible-tarball,
    community documentation website).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ballot on approval of new proposals and changes to policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify and train individuals from the community who are interested
    in contributing to Ansible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Be a catalyst for the Ansible Community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage all Ansible users to participate in the public Ansible
Community Meeting that occurs weekly in the #ansible-community IRC
channel on libera.chat every
&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/community/master/meetings/ical/community.ics"&gt;Wednesday at 18:00 UTC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we used a GitHub issue -
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/539"&gt;Community Working Group Meeting Agenda&lt;/a&gt; - earlier on to
track agenda topics for discussions in the weekly Ansible Community IRC meetings
Going forward, to track and categorize each topic separately, we've
created a new GitHub repository
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics"&gt;community-topics&lt;/a&gt;.
To discuss an idea, suggest improvements, or submit new
Policies/Proposals and New Collection Inclusion Requests, you will
create a &lt;a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/new"&gt;new issue&lt;/a&gt;
in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; as
a topic, and it'll be discussed publicly in the weekly IRC meeting.
After every meeting, the meeting minutes/summaries and meeting logs will
be posted to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/539"&gt;original issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Steering Committee will afford all interested persons an opportunity
to contribute and review, and will also afford all interested persons an
opportunity to speak on any idea during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ansible.com/blog/ansible-community-steering-committee/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Announcing the Community Ansible 3.0.0 Package</title><link>https://ansible.com/blog/announcing-the-community-ansible-3.0.0-package/</link><dc:creator>The Ansible Community Team</dc:creator><description>&lt;h2&gt;Announcing the Community Ansible 3.0.0 Package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 3.0.0 of the Ansible community package marks the end of the
restructuring of the Ansible ecosystem. This work culminates what began
in 2019 to restructure the Ansible
project
and shape how Ansible content was
delivered.
Starting with Ansible 3.0.0, the versioning and naming reflects the new
structure of the project in the following ways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The versioning methodology for the Ansible community package now
    adopts semantic versioning, and begins to diverge from the versions
    of the Ansible Core package (which contains the Ansible language and
    runtime)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The forthcoming Ansible Core package will be renamed from
    ansible-base in version 2.10 to ansible-core in version 2.11 for
    consistency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a little history. In Ansible 2.9 and prior, every plugin and
module was in the Ansible project
(&lt;a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible"&gt;https://github.com/ansible/ansible&lt;/a&gt;)
itself. When you installed the "ansible" package, you got the
language, runtime, and all content (modules and other plugins). Over
time, the overwhelming popularity of Ansible created scalability
concerns. Users had to wait many months for updated content. Developers
had to rely on Ansible maintainers to review and merge their content.
These obvious bottlenecks needed to be addressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Ansible 2.10 development cycle, the Ansible community
successfully migrated most modules and plugins into
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WOcqhk7TdYc"&gt;Collections&lt;/a&gt;. Collections, and the
modules and plugins within them, could now be developed, updated and
released independently of Ansible itself. When the migration was done,
what remained in the core project started shipping as ansible-base, and
the Ansible Community Team created a new Ansible community package. The
Ansible 2.10 community package included ansible-base 2.10 plus all the
Collections that contain modules and plugins that were migrated out of
the original repository. As of Ansible 2.10, community users had two
options:  continue installing everything with the Ansible community
package, or install ansible-base and then add selected Collections
individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, there are 3 distinct artefacts in the Ansible open source world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ansible Core - A minimal Ansible language and runtime (soon to be
    renamed from ansible-base)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ansible Collections on Galaxy (community supported)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ansible community package - Ansible installation including
    ansible-base/core plus community curated Collections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that these artefacts are managed separately, their versions are
diverging as well. Moving forward, Ansible Core will maintain its
existing numbering scheme (similar to the Linux Kernel). The next
version of Ansible Core after ansible-base 2.10 will be ansible-core
2.11. The Ansible community package (Ansible Core + community
Collections) is adopting semantic versioning. The next version of the
Ansible community package after 2.10 is 3.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the package is maintained and created has changed, but when you
install the Ansible community package, you still get the functionality
that existed in Ansible 2.9, with newer versions of modules and plugins.
Ansible 3.0.0 includes more than 85 Collections containing thousands of
modules and other plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many changes happening at once for the Ansible community, we
thought it was a good idea to put together a Q&amp;amp;A that can be found on
our blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ansible.com/blog/announcing-the-community-ansible-3.0.0-package/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ansible 3.0.0 Q&amp;A</title><link>https://ansible.com/blog/ansible-3.0.0-qa/</link><dc:creator>The Ansible Community Team</dc:creator><description>&lt;h2&gt;Ansible 3.0.0 Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ansible community team has
&lt;a href="https://www.ansible.com/blog/announcing-the-community-ansible-3.0.0-package"&gt;announced the release of Ansible 3.0.0&lt;/a&gt;
and here are the questions about the release that we've heard from
community members so far. If you have a question that is not answered
below, let us know on the &lt;a href="https://www.ansible.com/community"&gt;mailing lists or IRC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any changes to the Ansible language in 3.0.0?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no significant changes since the Ansible 3.0.0 package depends on the same version of ansible-base as Ansible 2.10.x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are the versions of ansible-base/ansible-core packages diverging from the Ansible package?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Ansible Community Team set out to restructure the Ansible project, Ansible was split into the following components: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core engine, modules and plugins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community and partner supported Ansible Collections of modules and plugins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former became known as ansible-base, soon to be
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/docs/docsite/rst/roadmap/ROADMAP_2_11.rst"&gt;ansible-core&lt;/a&gt;.
The latter became additions on top of the core, available either ad-hoc
or as part of the Ansible community package, which includes a set of
curated and maintained Collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semantic versioning of the Ansible package will let us signal
backwards-compatibility as well as breaking changes in the included
Collections independently of the core engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these are different components and different things, it is
appropriate for them to be versioned independently from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will ansible-base/ansible-core also adopt semantic versioning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the team managing ansible-core does not currently plan to adopt semantic versioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the correlation between Ansible 3.0.0 and ansible-base 2.10.x?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible 3.0.0 is a package that includes over &lt;a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/3/ansible-3.build"&gt;85 Ansible Collections&lt;/a&gt;.
It doesn't include ansible-base: it &lt;em&gt;depends&lt;/em&gt; on it and specifies a required version range such as &lt;em&gt;ansible-base&amp;gt;=2.10.6,&amp;lt;2.11&lt;/em&gt; so that the appropriate core package gets installed automatically.
For Ansible 4.0.0, this dependency will shift to &lt;em&gt;ansible-core&amp;gt;=2.11,&amp;lt;2.12&lt;/em&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ansible-base 2.10.x (as well as ansible-core in the near future) will continue to be available as a standalone package for users that prefer installing only the Collections they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is the range of included Collection versions established?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release build tooling queries the latest version of included Collections and determines the upper-limit based on that version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a collection's version is 1.5, the range would be &lt;em&gt;&amp;gt;=1.5,&amp;lt;2.0&lt;/em&gt;.
If the collection's version is 2.3, the range would be &lt;em&gt;&amp;gt;=2.3,&amp;lt;3.0&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea is to keep Collections within a single major version throughout the lifecycle of a single Ansible package major version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What version will ansible --version return?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ansible --version&lt;/code&gt; will return the version of ansible-base, not the version of the Ansible package, because ansible-base is the one providing the ansible command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Installing and upgrading&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I install Ansible 3.0.0?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ansible 3.0.0 Community package is &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/ansible/"&gt;released to PyPI&lt;/a&gt; and can be installed
with &lt;code&gt;pip install ansible==3.0.0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I upgrade to Ansible 3.0.0 from previous versions of Ansible? If so which ones?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To upgrade to Ansible-3.0 from Ansible-2.10: &lt;code&gt;pip install --upgrade ansible&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To upgrade to Ansible-3.0 from Ansible-2.9 or earlier: &lt;code&gt;pip uninstall ansible&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;pip install ansible&lt;/code&gt;.
  This is due to a limitation in pip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, but the command to upgrade is different depending on the version you have now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible 3.0.0 is based on ansible-base 2.10, so playbook syntax remains
the same between Ansible-2.10 and Ansible-3.0. However, there may be
incompatibilities in some modules and plugins as Ansible-3.0.0 allows
backwards-incompatible changes in Collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will I be able to upgrade to Ansible 4.0.0 from Ansible 3.0.0?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, but you will have to uninstall and reinstall again, due to
the renaming of ansible-base to ansible-core: &lt;code&gt;pip uninstall ansible&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;pip install ansible&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible 4.0.0 will be based on
ansible-core 2.11, so playbook syntax in Ansible 4.0.0 may
include backwards incompatible changes (ansible-core does not
use semantic versioning, so updates to the minor version can
contain backwards incompatible changes).  When Ansible 4.0.0 is
ready to start its pre-release cycle, porting guides will be
available to help guide you through those
changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Release cadence and scope&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the release cadence moving forward?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor version releases of the Ansible package (such as 3.1.0,
3.2.0) are planned for every three weeks.  These releases will
include new backwards-compatible features, modules and plugins
as well as bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major version releases of the Ansible package (such as 4.0.0,
5.0.0) will happen after new releases of ansible-core. The
Ansible 4.0.0 release is planned for May 2021, soon after the
release of ansible-core 2.11 in April. After 4.0.0, a six month
release cycle for major versions will become the normal cadence,
with 5.0.0 releasing in November, trailing the planned 2.12
release of ansible-core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much change will each minor and major version of Ansible contain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each minor release of the Ansible community package will accept
only backwards-compatible changes in included Collections.
Collections must also use semantic versioning, so the Collection
version numbers will reflect this rule. For example, if Ansible
3.0.0 releases with community.general 2.0.0, then all minor
releases of Ansible 3.x (such as Ansible 3.1.0 or Ansible 3.5.0)
would include a 2.x release of community.general (such as 2.8.0
or 2.9.5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each major release of the Ansible community package will accept
the latest released version of each included Collection and may
include the latest released version of ansible-core. Major
releases of the Ansible community package can contain breaking
changes in the modules and other plugins within the included
Collections and/or in core features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What changes will each patch release contain, given the use of semantic versioning here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patch releases will be used only when bugs are discovered that
warrant a targeted fix for with a quick turnaround.  For
instance, if a packaging bug is discovered in our release of
3.1.0 that prevents Debian packages from being built, a 3.1.1
release may occur the next day that fixes that issue. No new
features are allowed in patch releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Packaging&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Ansible 3.0.0 be made available as an upstream RPM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. RPM-based Linux distros, such as &lt;a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/ansible"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;,
have been creating superior RPM packages of Ansible for a while
now. So we decided for Ansible-2.10 and ansible-base-2.10, the
Ansible project would no longer provide pre-built RPMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Ansible 3.0.0 be available on Ubuntu Launchpad?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. The Ansible Community Team is catching up to the changes
in how the Ansible content is packaged but plan to have releases
in the PPA soon.  The team is currently testing a new GitHub
action to build the debs for the PPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Terminology&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ansible package&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An all-in-one software package (Python, deb, rpm, etc) that
provides backwards compatibility with Ansible 2.9 by including
modules and plugins that have since been migrated to Ansible
Collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ansible package depends on ansible-base (soon ansible-core).
So when you do pip install ansible, pip installs ansible-base
automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible 3.0.0 contains more Collections thanks to the wider
Ansible community reviewing Collections against the community
checklist. This list of what's included can be found at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/tree/master/2.10"&gt;ansible-build-data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A packaging format for bundling and distributing Ansible
content: plugins, roles, modules, playbooks, documentation and
more. Can be released independent of other Collections or
ansible-base so features and bug
fixes can be made available sooner to users.
    Installed from source repositories, from
&lt;a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/"&gt;galaxy.ansible.com&lt;/a&gt; via
&lt;code&gt;ansible-galaxy collection install &amp;lt;namespace.collection&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or using a &lt;a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/using/installing.html#installing-multiple-roles-from-a-file"&gt;requirements.yml file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;ansible-base&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New for 2.10. The codebase that is now contained in
&lt;code&gt;github.com/ansible/ansible&lt;/code&gt; for the Ansible 2.10 release. It
contains a minimal amount of modules and plugins and allows
other Collections to be installed. Similar to Ansible 2.9 though
without any content that has since moved into a Collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renamed to ansible-core in the devel branch of Ansible and will
be released under that name from version 2.11 onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercially available enterprise offering from Red Hat,
combining multiple Ansible focused projects, including
ansible-core, awx, galaxy_ng, Collections and various Red Hat
tools focused on an integrated Ansible user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ansible.com/blog/ansible-3.0.0-qa/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thoughts on Restructuring the Ansible Project</title><link>https://ansible.com/blog/thoughts-on-restructuring-the-ansible-project/</link><dc:creator>The Ansible Community Team</dc:creator><description>&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts on Restructuring the Ansible Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible became popular largely because we adopted some key principles
early, and stuck to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first key principle was simplicity: simple to install, simple to
use, simple to find documentation and examples, simple to write
playbooks, and simple to make contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second key principle was modularity: Ansible functionality could be
easily extended by writing modules, and anyone could write a module and
contribute it back to Ansible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third key principle was "batteries included": all of the modules for
Ansible would be built-in, so you wouldn't have to figure out where to
get them. They'd just be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've come a long way by following these principles, and we intend to
stick to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently though, we've been reevaluating how we might better structure
Ansible to support these principles. We now find ourselves dealing with
problems of scale that are becoming more challenging to solve. Jan-Piet
Mens, who has continued to be a close friend to Ansible since our very
earliest days, recently described those problems &lt;a href="https://jpmens.net/2019/06/21/i-care-about-ansible/"&gt;quite
succinctly&lt;/a&gt; from
his perspective as a long-time contributor -- and I think his analysis
of the problems we face is quite accurate. Simply, we've become victims
of our own success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success means growth, and growth means more users, more customers, more
contributors, and more responsibilities -- which  bring increases in
complexity. We've continued to build tools like
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot"&gt;Ansibot&lt;/a&gt; to help us manage that
complexity, but as we continue towards hyperscale, even as we merge more
and more community code, we're seeing more pull requests and issues fall
through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following visual representation of the evolution of contributions to the Ansible project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="visual representation of the evolution of contributions to the Ansible project" src="https://ansible.com/images/posts/archive/evolution-of-contributions.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our current challenges stem from &lt;strong&gt;increased complexity that our
simple model was not built to handle&lt;/strong&gt;. If we want to break through our
current constraints, we're going to need to build a new organizational
model to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's exactly what we've been working on -- and it's taking some time,
because it's a complex set of challenges -- but we're getting there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's discuss some of our key challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there's the &lt;strong&gt;growing support challenge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, Ansible had a simple policy: if we shipped it, we supported
it. In the very beginning, this policy made perfect sense; we had
comparatively few modules, and we also had comparatively few customers.
The Ansible support team knew all of the modules well enough to provide
support for all of them, to anyone who was willing to pay for that
support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, though, supporting modules ourselves can be a tricky
proposition, and the larger we grow, the trickier it becomes. The
majority of our modules are &lt;a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/community_maintained.html"&gt;community
maintained&lt;/a&gt;.
We obviously know Ansible itself very well, but we don't know the
community maintained modules as well as our contributors do. In some
cases, we may not even have access to the underlying software or
hardware with which the modules interface; in such cases we are
completely reliant upon our community to keep the modules working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of our community maintainers are exceptionally responsive. Some are
less responsive. That's the nature of community developed software. But
because all of the modules live in the same place, and are a part of our
"batteries included" model, many people -- including paying customers
-- don't realize that such a distinction exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unfair for us to place an enterprise support burden on volunteer
contributors. It's also important that we're as clear as possible with
our customers about what is fully supported as part of their
subscription, and what is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, there's &lt;strong&gt;the lifecycle challenge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ansible itself becomes more mature and used by more enterprise
customers, the lifecycle of Ansible is slowing down. Even until fairly
recently, we would cut a major release of Ansible every four months, but
our most recent release cycle was eight months, and that slower release
cycle will become the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a challenge because it means that over time it will take longer
for new code to reach users. This will be especially constraining for
our partners; under the current structure, they can only update their
modules and plug-ins on our schedule. We've already received feedback
from many partners that they want the ability to release their own
modules and plugins independently of our release cycle, and as our
release cycle continues to slow down, we expect these calls to grow
louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there's &lt;strong&gt;the challenge of the rising bar&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone, both partners and community, want modules to be ever better:
better written, better tested, more secure. With every release, we try
to raise the quality bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the upcoming Ansible 2.9 release, for instance, we expect soon to be
asking contributors &lt;a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/57699"&gt;to provide basic integration
tests&lt;/a&gt; for every
module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That rising bar comes with its own challenges. How do we handle
contributions that have previously been good enough, but no longer meet
the new standards? How do we deal with contributors who are not
necessarily able or willing to do the work necessary to reach these
standards? What do we do about existing modules that don't keep up with
our rising quality standard -- do we mark them in some way, or do we
kick them out of Ansible entirely, even if they're relatively stable
modules that a lot of people depend upon? We continue to grapple with
these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the &lt;strong&gt;new module contributor challenge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="graph of survival curves for Ansible PRs in the past year" src="https://ansible.com/images/posts/archive/ansible-survival-curves.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the average merge time for PRs. New Modules (blue) vs everything else
(Red). Notice that over the past year, on average 80% of non-new-module
PRs are merged within 22.4 days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the quality bar goes up, our ability to bring new contributors
onboard goes down -- or at least slows down. It just takes contributors
more time and effort to get their new modules accepted than it once did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's comparatively easy to bring in PRs to extant modules, because those
modules generally have maintainers that have earned our collective
trust. Our PR merge numbers for extant modules are actually quite good
(we can always improve, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But new modules require a higher degree of vetting, because we're not
only vetting the code, we're also implicitly vetting the contributors of
that code for their interest and ability to maintain that code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given our current structure, this is an unfortunate but necessary
barrier. Our support challenge makes us more reluctant to merge new
modules without strong assurances that the maintainer will be willing
and able to maintain those modules to increasingly stringent
requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of all of these challenges is the fact that we've got one
code base that's supporting two categories of participants that have
different primary interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise users and partners need, more than anything, a stable and
well supported platform that they can trust to automate their IT
infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our community users and contributors need something else, and that's
what Ansible has always delivered in the past: an easy way to install
Ansible, and easy ways to contribute to Ansible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those of us who lived through the old days at Red Hat, these problems
are eerily similar to the problems we experienced around the original
Red Hat Linux product -- problems that led to the creation of the
Fedora Project and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Our problems aren't
identical, but similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why we believe that the solutions should be not identical, but
similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about &lt;strong&gt;our proposal to solve some of these challenges&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;strong&gt;a development perspective&lt;/strong&gt;, Ansible would be &lt;strong&gt;broken out into
different components&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;core engine&lt;/strong&gt;, which would essentially be the platform to run
everything else. Keeping this engine stable, more secure, and
well-tested will be critically important for everyone. The Core Team
would be responsible for maintaining this engine. Community contribution
policies would be the same as present policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;core modules and plugins&lt;/strong&gt;, which are the modules and plugins
that the Ansible team would support directly. These would be the most
used modules and plugins (think template, copy, lineinfile, and so on.)
Community contribution policies would be the same as present policies,
though no new modules would be introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;community modules and plugins&lt;/strong&gt;, which would be where most
non-core modules and plugins would live. Community contribution policies
would be relaxed to some degree, to help onboard new content and new
contributors, but we would still maintain a bar of quality to help
ensure that community content would be functional, documented, and
usable. The separate structure would allow the community to be much more
effectively involved in the curation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various supported &lt;strong&gt;partner modules and plugins&lt;/strong&gt;, which would be
broken out and managed more directly by partners. Community contribution
policies would be up to the discretion of the individual partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these different components would be built in the form of
&lt;strong&gt;Ansible Content Collections&lt;/strong&gt;, which we first introduced in Ansible
2.8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;strong&gt;deployment perspective&lt;/strong&gt;, Ansible would be delivered in one of
two fundamental ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;batteries-included method&lt;/strong&gt;, which would be very similar to how
Ansible is delivered currently: a bundling of the core engine, all of
the core modules and plugins, all of the community modules and plugins,
and select partner modules and plugins, all via collections. There would
be no official Red Hat support offered for this method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;supported enterprise method&lt;/strong&gt;, which would be only the fully
supported subset of that content: the core modules and plugins, and
select partner modules and plugins, all via collections. This would be
the method that would be supported by Red Hat as part of the Red Hat
Ansible Automation product. Customers would retain the ability to
install and use any additional content at their discretion, but the
separation between Red Hat supported content and non-Red Hat supported
content would be much more explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these methods would depend heavily on Ansible Galaxy as the de
facto delivery mechanism, which we would plan to improve substantially
to handle the increased traffic load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may note that there are similarities between this new proposed
structure and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras"&gt;Ansible Extras&lt;/a&gt; structure
that we moved to, and then &lt;a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.6/dev_guide/repomerge.html"&gt;moved away from&lt;/a&gt;, a
few years back. It's true; there are definite similarities, and many of
the advantages and potential disadvantages are the same. It's our hope,
and intention, to learn the lessons from that previous attempt to gain
the advantages while also mitigating the potential disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that these structural changes will help Ansible keep our
strong community focus, while also providing the structure necessary to
support our growing base of partners and customers. We recognize that
these are significant changes, which is why we plan to move very
carefully towards them. We want to make sure that we understand the
implications of these changes before we make them. None of these changes
are imminent, but we believe that we've come to a point at which we are
prepared to discuss the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many questions yet to be answered: infrastructure questions,
licensing questions, release policy questions, and others. We will be
discussing some of those questions in an upcoming webinar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also be digging deeply into these questions at our community
contributor conference at AnsibleFest Atlanta in September. We hope to
see our contributors there in person, but we strive for &lt;a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/ansible-summit-atlanta-2019"&gt;full remote participation&lt;/a&gt;
as well, as always. Please join us however you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of Ansible, we could only have dreamt of this kind of
success. In our seven years of existence, we have built
&lt;a href="https://octoverse.github.com/projects"&gt;one of the top open source projects in the world&lt;/a&gt;, with a dedicated
community pushing us and supporting us from the very beginning. Had we
imagined the kinds of challenges we face today, we would surely have put
them in the category of "good problems to have."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But "good problems" are still problems, and if we fail to solve them,
they won't stay "good problems" for long. It's time for us to take the
next step, so that we can continue to be a reliable partner for all of
our users, customers, and contributors. Without all of you, we would
never have made it nearly so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ansible.com/blog/thoughts-on-restructuring-the-ansible-project/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Song Remains The Same</title><link>https://ansible.com/blog/red-hat-and-ibm-and-the-ansible-community/</link><dc:creator>The Ansible Community Team</dc:creator><description>&lt;h2&gt;The Song Remains The Same&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-closes-landmark-acquisition-red-hat-34-billion-defines-open-hybrid-cloud-future"&gt;Now that Red Hat is a part of IBM&lt;/a&gt;,
some people may wonder about the future of the Ansible project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the good news: the Ansible community strategy has not changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we want to make it as easy as possible to work with any
projects and communities who want to work with Ansible. With the
resources of IBM behind us, we plan to accelerate these efforts. We want
to do more integrations with more open source communities and more
technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons we are excited for the merger is that IBM understands
the importance of a broad and diverse community. Search for "Ansible
plus open source project" and you can find Ansible information, such
as playbooks and modules and blog posts and videos and slide decks,
intended to make working with that project easier. We have thousands of
people attending Ansible meetups and events all over the world. We have
millions of downloads. We have had this momentum because we provide
users flexibility and freedom. IBM is committed to our independence as a
community so that we can continue this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've worked hard to be good open source citizens. We value the trust
that we've built with our users and our contributors, and we intend to
continue to live up to the trust that our community has placed in us.
IBM is committed to the same ideals and will be supportive of our
ongoing efforts to build a strong, diverse community. The song remains
the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions or would like to learn more about the IBM
acquisition, we encourage you to review the list of materials below. Red
Hat CTO Chris Wright will host an online Q&amp;amp;A session July 23 in the
coming days where you can ask questions you may have about what the
acquisition means for Red Hat and our involvement in open source
communities. Details will be announced on the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog"&gt;Red Hat blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
