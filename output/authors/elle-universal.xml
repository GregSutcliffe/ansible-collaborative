&lt;p&gt;At AnsibleFest 2022, the power of automation was on full display.
Through sessions, workshops, labs and more, we explored how to transform
enterprise and industry through automation. There were a lot of exciting
&lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/ansiblefest-newsroom"&gt;announcements&lt;/a&gt;
made on both days, and in case you missed it, we are going to dive into
what is new!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ansible and AWS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to also announce a new AWS Marketplace offering, Red Hat
Ansible Automation Platform. By offering Ansible Automation Platform as
a pre-integrated service that can be quickly deployed from cloud
marketplaces, we are meeting our customers where they are, while giving
them the flexibility to deliver any application, anywhere, without
additional overhead or complexity. Whether you are automating your
hybrid cloud or multi-cloud environments, Ansible Automation Platform
acts as a single platform. This platform provides consistency,
visibility, and control to help  you manage these environments at scale.
Ansible is the IT automation "glue" for bringing your cloud, network,
bare-metal and cloud-native infrastructure together. This  provides the
functionality to coordinate and manage across  hybrid cloud environments
in a simple and efficient way. Interested in learning more? Check out
the &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-introduces-red-hat-ansible-automation-platform-aws-marketplace"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automation at the Edge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible Automation Platform provides a framework for building and
operating IT automation at scale. What this means for edge, much like
the data center, is that users across an entire organization can create,
share, and manage automation. They can develop and apply guidelines for 
using automation within individual groups. They can write tasks that use
existing knowledge so they can be leveraged by nonIT staff, allowing
end-to-end automation to be deployed. Ansible Automation Platform uses
containerization to package, distribute, and execute automation across
environments securely via automation execution environments. This
enables organizations to rapidly and consistently extend IT services to
the edge, while maintaining a focus on security. This helps
organizations to simplify capacity scaling, increase resiliency, and
improve consistency. Learn more about automation at the edge
&lt;a href="http://ansible.com/use-cases/edge"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Event-Driven Ansible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event-Driven Ansible is a new capability that we're making available to
the entire Ansible open source community in developer preview. With
Event-Driven Ansible, you can eliminate low-level tasks from the
day-to-day routine so you have more time to focus on innovations. This
means a happier, more productive, and more engaged team. It is fast,
accurate, and will free you (and your teams) to work on the things you
WANT to be doing, without being dragged down by all the things you HAVE
to do. Event--Driven Ansible will support a range of use cases, and here
are few good ones to get started with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating remediation of common problems, like resetting a network router that's out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gathering information to solve problems faster, like information about a server configuration or buffer pool size so when you get the service ticket, the information you need is already there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administering user requests ... like "I can't log in" or "I cannot access the application".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited about the future of automation and what is possible with
Event-Driven Ansible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Project Wisdom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-and-ibm-research-advance-it-automation-ai-powered-capabilities-ansible"&gt;Project Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;
is a Red Hat initiative, developed in close collaboration with IBM
Research, to give Ansible artificial intelligence superpowers. The first
goal is to bring together automation novices and Ansible experts while
enabling new automators to drastically reduce the challenge of learning
and mastering Ansible. The first capability we are using AI for is
content generation. The AI models we use underneath Project Wisdom are
able to generate Ansible Playbooks or roles that are both syntactically
correct and functional. You can also head to redhat.com/wisdom for more
information on how to get involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ansible Automation Platform 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible Automation Platform 2 is built to enable a trusted automation
supply chain. In the upcoming  Ansible Automation Platform 2.3 release,
digital signing will be supported for containers, playbooks and
collections. We're also excited to introduce
Ansible validated content, which
complements the  existing  ecosystem of Red Hat Ansible Certified
Content Collections. Ansible validated content helps your teams to start
automating faster by following a trusted, expert-led, opinionated path
for performing operations and tasks on both Red Hat and third party
platforms. Initially, Ansible validated content will be pre-loaded into
private automation hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are so fortunate that we are a part of one of the largest, most
vibrant open source project communities in the world. So while the
landscape may be shifting around us, Ansible continues to push forward
and evolve with the times. Ansible is celebrating its 10th anniversary
this year! Within our expansive community, the new Working Groups focus
on expanding the Ansible ecosystem with the development of Ansible
Content Collections. First spun up by our team last year, Matrix has
made a huge difference in our ability to connect and engage with the
Ansible community. So far we've spun up 32 unique chat rooms, with 4200+
members and nearly 80k messages sent in the past 6 months. Matrix's
ability to bridge with IRC gave us a strong foundation upon which to
build. Join the Working Groups and become a part of the conversation:

&lt;p&gt;It is almost time for our favorite event of the year! AnsibleFest is
back as an in-person event, and it's the only place to feel the full
power of automation. &lt;a href="http://ansiblefest.com/"&gt;Join us&lt;/a&gt; October 18 and 19 in Chicago, and immerse
yourself in the movement that's made Ansible an industry-leading
automation technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AnsibleFest 2022 session catalog and agenda builder are now
available. That means you can see all this year's session content and
build your own custom experience. Let's take a closer look at all that
AnsibleFest 2022 has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Breakout Sessions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we will be featuring six content tracks. These tracks
include: Getting Started with Automation, the Ansible Community,
Automation Applied, Ansible Automation Platform, Advanced Ansible, and
Automation Adoption. Sessions across these tracks will cover a range of
focus areas, including network automation, security automation,
automation at the edge, IT leaders, developers, and several more. We
also have a wide range of customer, partner, and Ansible contributor
talks to join. You can see a list of all the sessions being offered in
our &lt;a href="https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/rhaf22/SessionCatalog2022?tab.day=20221018"&gt;session catalog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Workshops and Labs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get hands-on experience at AnsibleFest in our workshops and labs. We
will have a mixture of self-paced and instructor led workshops for our

&lt;h3&gt;Spotlight Sessions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, we're introducing a new session segment, Spotlight Stage.
These sessions will be 15 minute lightning talks and demos from key
Ansible customers and partners, with an interactive component where the
speakers will answer questions from the audience. The Spotlight Stage
will be attached directly to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
booth in the expo hall for easy access for all
attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Communities of Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Communities of Practice are a new set of open forums in the
AnsibleFest Hallway Track for this year's AnsibleFest. These are 30
minute open forums led by Ansible experts in a set of diverse topics.
The audience will drive the discussion on
these topics based on what they want to learn from the experts. We will
be covering topics that include automation community + enthusiasm,
network automation, Ansible Automation Platform, automation at the edge,
security automation, event-driven automation, and cloud
automation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ask the Expert&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As AnsibleFest returns in-person, we're excited to bring back the Ask
the Expert area. Here, you can get one-on-one time with Ansible experts
to ask any burning questions about automation. We will now feature a
larger space with designated areas for each expert's individual
expertise, helping ensure you can find the right person for your
questions. Experts will cover a wide range of topics that include
product components and features, migrations, as well as use
case-specific topics, like edge, network and event-driven
automation.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ansible.com/blog/the-automation-experience-ansiblefest-2022/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Automation at the Edge, Summit 2022</title><link>https://ansible.com/blog/automation-at-the-edge-summit-2022/</link><dc:creator>Elle Universal</dc:creator><description>&lt;h2&gt;Automation at the Edge, Summit 2022&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know, Red Hat Summit was back in person in Boston
last week. For those who are not familiar, Red Hat Summit is the premier
enterprise open source event for IT professionals to learn, collaborate,
and innovate on technologies from the datacenter and public cloud to the
edge and beyond. Red Hat made a lot of exciting announcements, with
several that included Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.
If you could not make the event or would like to revisit some of the
content, you can access any session &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/summit"&gt;on demand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big
&lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-unveils-new-levels-security-software-supply-chain-edge"&gt;announcements&lt;/a&gt;
at Summit was the unveiling of new levels of security from the software
supply chain to the edge. In Ansible Automation Platform 2.2, Red Hat is
introducing a technical preview of Ansible content signing technology.
The new capability helps with software supply chain security by enabling
automation teams to validate that the automation content being executed
in their enterprise is verified and trusted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the announcement of this new edge capability, we showcased a
session for Ansible and edge that is available on demand. The session
&lt;a href="https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/sum22/SessionCatalog22/session/1640789672821001p0oM"&gt;"GitOps your distributed edge computing model with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform"&lt;/a&gt;
covers how Ansible Automation Platform, in combination with GitOps, can
decrease the time to market and repair time to deploy and operate
network edge infrastructure. It includes a demo that shows how to
describe a deployment in Git, which works as a single source of truth.
You will be able to see how Ansible Automation Platform enforces the
correct state of the network infrastructure of a large-scale
organization and its tracking through IT Service Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling automation anywhere using Ansible Automation Platform
&lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-introduces-new-cross-portfolio-edge-capabilities"&gt;Red Hat introduced new cross-portfolio edge capabilities&lt;/a&gt;,
including features in Ansible Automation Platform that solves the
management and automation needs to drive visibility and consistency
across an organization's edge deployments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session &lt;a href="https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/sum22/SessionCatalog22/session/1641398142450001vmkJ"&gt;"Ansible Automation Platform 2 automation mesh-starting locally, scaling globally"&lt;/a&gt;
covers how to scale automation to successfully execute in distributed
edge locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automating RHEL at the edge with Ansible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you watched the keynote presentation, you heard about the release of
a &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-introduces-new-cross-portfolio-edge-capabilities"&gt;SaaS Edge Manager&lt;/a&gt;.
However, we realize not everyone can use the cloud to manage their
fleet. Below is how to add a postscript to your kickstart file to
register your devices directly to an Ansible Automation Platform
inventory so you can use it to manage your fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;# Create ansible playbook to register device to Ansible automation platform&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;cat &amp;gt; /tmp/add_to_aap.yml &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nn"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;hosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w w-Error"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;vars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;aap_password=changeme&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;gather_facts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'{ipaddress:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;ansible_all_ipv4_addresses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;}}",&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;macaddress:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;ansible_default_ipv4.macaddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;}}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;}'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;force_basic_auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;201&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body_format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;validate_certs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;ansible-playbook /tmp/add_to_aap.yml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Inventory creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the inventory in Ansible Automation Platform, and get the
    inventory number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get the URL: in this example, the inventory ID is 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="url example" src="https://ansible.com/images/posts/archive/edge-inventory-creation.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://AAPHOST.fqdn.com/#/inventories/inventory/2/details&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assign aap_url in vars section:
    &lt;code&gt;aap_url = https://AAPHOST.fqdn.com/api/v2/inventories/2/hosts/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Create credentials in Ansible Automation Platform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assign credentials to &lt;code&gt;aap_ks_user&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;aap_ks_password&lt;/code&gt; in the Access Users tab in Ansible Automation Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Check Ansible Automation Platform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now see your devices in Ansible Automation Platform after they boot up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who joined us over the past two days for the
AnsibleFest 2020 virtual experience. We had such a great time connecting
with Ansible lovers across the globe. In case you missed some of it (or
all of it), we have some event highlights to share with you! If you want
to go see what you may have missed, all the AnsibleFest 2020 content
will be &lt;a href="https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&amp;amp;ShowUUID=0D7D869A-8D51-4DED-9E1B-6699B9D36B9C"&gt;available on demand&lt;/a&gt;
for a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Community Updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year at AnsibleFest 2020, Ansible Community Architect Robyn
Bergeron kicked off with her keynote on Tuesday morning. We heard how
with Ansible Content Collections, it's easier than ever to use Ansible
the way you want or need to, as a contributor or an end user. Ansible
2.10 is now available, and Robyn explained how the feedback loop got us
there. If you want to hear more about the Ansible community project, go
watch Robyn's keynote &lt;a href="https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&amp;amp;ShowUUID=0D7D869A-8D51-4DED-9E1B-6699B9D36B9C"&gt;on demand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Product Updates&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible's own Richard Henshall talked about the Red Hat Ansible
Automation Platform product updates and new releases. In 2018, we
unveiled the Ansible certified partner program and now we have over 50
platforms certified. We are bridging traditional platforms, containers
and edge with a new integration between Red Hat Advanced Cluster
Management for Kubernetes and Ansible Automation Platform. Learn more
about the new integration from our &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-expands-automation-hybrid-clouds-red-hat-ansible-automation-platform-integration-red-hat-openshift-environments"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.
This year at AnsibleFest, we also introduced private Automation Hub,
where users can now manage and curate Ansible content privately, from
trusted sources. You can learn more about this and other Ansible
Automation Platform updates from our &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-accelerates-hybrid-cloud-automation-catalog-ready-use-certified-and-supported-ansible-automation"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.
You can also listen to Richard's full keynote in the AnsibleFest
platform &lt;a href="https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&amp;amp;ShowUUID=0D7D869A-8D51-4DED-9E1B-6699B9D36B9C"&gt;on demand now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Channel Content&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AnsibleFest 2020 showcased six channels of content; with something for
everyone. Some popular talks included the Ansible Automation Platform
Roadmap, Managing your own Private Ansible Content, Ansible Automation
Platform Technical Content Strategy, How to manage your Ansible
automation and how your automation is performing with analytics, and
much more! All 70+ breakout sessions are available on demand now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope everyone enjoyed our first virtual AnsibleFest. Thank you to all
our attendees who helped make AnsibleFest 2020 the largest and most
successful AnsibleFest to date. To see more highlights of the event, you
can visit the &lt;a href="http://ansiblefest.com/"&gt;AnsibleFest homepage&lt;/a&gt;. Don't
forget, all the content will be available until October 2021, so you can
go back and &lt;a href="https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&amp;amp;ShowUUID=0D7D869A-8D51-4DED-9E1B-6699B9D36B9C"&gt;watch the content&lt;/a&gt;
whenever you would like. Thank you for connecting with us this year and
happy automating!&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ansible.com/blog/best-of-fest-ansiblefest-2020/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Customer Spotlights at AnsibleFest 2020</title><link>https://ansible.com/blog/customer-spotlights-at-ansiblefest-2020/</link><dc:creator>Elle Universal</dc:creator><description>&lt;h2&gt;Customer Spotlights at AnsibleFest 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AnsibleFest 2020 will be here before we know it, and we cannot wait to
connect with everyone in October. We have some great content lined up
for this year's virtual experience and that includes some amazing
customer spotlights. This year you will get to hear from CarMax, Blue
Cross Blue Shield of NC, T-Mobile, and Cepsa. These customers are using
Ansible in a variety of ways, and we hope you connect to their
incredible stories of teamwork and transformative automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer Spotlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Blizard, a Network Engineer at T-Mobile, will explore how
T-Mobile transformed from a disparate organization with difficulty
enforcing standards to a collaborative group of engineers working from
repeatable templates and processes. T-Mobile, a major telecommunications
provider, uses Ansible Automation Platform to standardize processes
across their organization. Ben will show how automation supports
T-Mobile's compliance standards, data integrity, and produces speed and
efficiency for network teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Bojovic, Director of Systems Engineering at Blue Cross Blue Shield
of North Carolina, will talk about how they used automation to drive
down costs in managed service costs while increasing productivity. Blue
Cross NC, a leading health insurance provider, recently implemented a
new tool to automate provisioning of their virtual machines for critical
on-premise applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of Blue Cross NC's deployment team will also speak on a panel
interview setup, featuring: Tobin Shay, Alex Devirgilis and Pavan
Mutyala. They will discuss their recent experiences using automation to
handle a large-scale migration and the future of automation at Blue
Cross NC. The interview will also touch on how a large organization
works to decrease a reliance on managed services, and the planning and
processes that lead to a projected 16-week project being completed in
just three business days.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ansible.com/blog/customer-spotlights-at-ansiblefest-2020/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
