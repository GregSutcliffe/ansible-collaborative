&lt;p&gt;Everyday, I'm in awe of what Ansible has grown to be. The incredible
growth of the community and viral adoption of the technology has
resulted in a content management challenge for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to echo a lot of what's been said by our dear friend
&lt;a href="https://jpmens.net/2019/06/21/i-care-about-ansible/"&gt;Jan-Piet Mens&lt;/a&gt;
or our incredible Community team, but give me a moment to take a shot at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main challenge is rooted in the ability to scale. The volume of pull
requests and issues we see day to day severely outweigh the ability of
the Ansible community to keep up with that rate of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, we are embarking on a journey. This journey is one that we
know that the community, both our content creators and content
consumers, will be interested in hearing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This New World Order (tongue in cheek), as we've been calling it, is a
model that will allow for us to empower the community of contributors of
Ansible content (read: modules, plugins, and roles) to provide their
content at their own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, we have made some changes to how Ansible leverages content
that is not "shipped" with it. In short, Ansible content will not have
to be a part of a milestone Core release of the Engine itself. We will
be leveraging a delivery process and content structure/format that helps
alleviate a lot of the ambiguity and pain that is currently there due to
tying plugins to the Core Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cornerstone of this journey is something you may have heard
rumblings of out in the interwebs. This thing is called a Ansible
Content Collection, or Collection(s), for short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create Ansible Content Collections, we took a look at a lot of things
already in practice. We looked at other tools, other packaging formats,
delivery engines, repositories, and ultimately, ourselves. In all of
that investigation we feel we have come up with a pretty sound spec.
Below we cover some details of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Collection is a strict project/directory structure for Ansible
Content. Similar to the role directory structure; we are now
highlighting what is important to Ansible Playbook execution. Here's a
graphic of that spec, created by my teammate, Tim Appnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot_future-of-content-1" src="https://ansible.com/images/posts/archive/screenshot_future-of-content-1.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this structure does look very similar to roles. There
are some slight differences though. Notice that the roles directory no
longer contains a library folder? The idea here is that a Collection
itself is the true encapsulation of every piece of content relevant to
it, and the playbook that is executing that content. So we've taken the
libraries out of the various roles that could live in a collection, and
placed them at the top level in the plugins directory. There, all types
of plugins (yes modules are there because modules are actually plugins)
will be usable by the roles and ultimately all playbooks that could
potentially call them. Because this content will be "installed" in a
location that the Engine is aware of, and will know to look for content
that is being called in the playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, with these changes, we have introduced some namespacing concepts
into playbooks as well. Here's another graphic, by Tim, that is a
snippet out of a playbook that highlights that namespacing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot_future-of-content-2" src="https://ansible.com/images/posts/archive/screenshot_future-of-content-2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we've got here is a very simple playbook. In this playbook we
have highlighted the list of Collections that we're interested in using.
For each task, we are using the FQCN (Fully Qualified Collection
Namespace) path to the module. Of course, we still want to make this
simple. So playbook creators won't have to always fully qualify their
content path. As you see in the fourth task, creators can still use the
shorthand name of a module. Ansible will search the path of collections
in a first come first serve approach, as defined in Ansible
configuration or within the play itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's about all I've got for going into Collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Automating folks!&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ansible.com/blog/the-future-of-ansible-content-delivery/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
