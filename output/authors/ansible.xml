&lt;p&gt;Each year, AnsibleFest is one of our favorite events because it brings
together our customers, partners, community members and Red Hatters to
talk about the open source innovations and best practices that are
enabling the future of enterprise technology and automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the safety of our attendees is our first priority, we have
decided to make AnsibleFest 2020 a virtual experience. We are excited to
connect with everyone virtually, and look forward to expanding our
conversation across the globe. By changing our event platform, we hope
to use this opportunity to collaborate, connect, and chat with more
automation fans than ever before. It is exciting to think about how many
more people will be able to join in on the automation conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AnsibleFest Virtual Experience will be a free, immersive multi-day
event the week of October 12th, 2020, that will deliver timely and
useful customer keynotes, breakout sessions, direct access to Ansible
experts, and more. You will want to sign up to stay connected and
up-to-date on all things AnsibleFest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for proposals is open&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still working through the details for the virtual event, but are
very excited to announce that the &lt;a href="https://ansiblefest2020.eventpoint.com/cfp"&gt;call for proposals&lt;/a&gt; is
&lt;strong&gt;now open through July 15&lt;/strong&gt;. We will post additional information on the Ansible Blog
and on the AnsibleFest site as it
becomes available. Stay tuned! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to hosting this event and thank you all in advance for
your collaboration to make this a great success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why did you cancel the in-person AnsibleFest event?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been closely monitoring the feasibility of the physical event in
San Diego and have decided to rebuild AnsibleFest 2020 as a virtual
event. Our goal is to serve and support AnsibleFest attendees with a
virtual celebration that captures the immersive AnsibleFest experience,
and allows us to welcome an even larger audience than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What will you be doing instead of an in-person event?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be hosting the AnsibleFest Virtual Experience, a free, immersive
multi-day event from October 13-14, 2020, that delivers the same
inspiring content from AnsibleFest 2020 - keynotes, breakout sessions,
access to experts, and more.  We are still working through many of the
details for the virtual event, but we are excited about the opportunity
to share content selected to help you transform your organization by
delivering the right Automation strategy, combined with the cultural
change needed to succeed in the constantly  evolving digital journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current world of Cloud and DevOps, Automation can be used to
enable open ways of working in order to build business resilience and
innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How do I register for  the AnsibleFest virtual experience?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information and details on registration will be announced within the
month of June. Follow Red Hat Ansible - &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ansible"&gt;\@ansible on
Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and sign up for information on our
site &lt;a href="http://www.ansiblefest.com/"&gt;www.ansiblefest.com&lt;/a&gt;  to get all
information as it becomes available.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Will there be sponsorship opportunities for the AnsibleFest virtual experience?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there will be sponsorship opportunities available. These will be
released later this summer. Questions? Please reach out to the
&lt;a href="mailto:sponsorships@redhat.com"&gt;sponsorship team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Will you be having any in-person events later?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are exploring that situation, and will announce any plans we have. 
But for now, we hope you can join our virtual experience on October
13-14!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;When is AnsibleFest in 2021?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A date has not been set for AnsibleFest in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What kind of software will be required to view keynotes and interact with the experts at the virtual event? Will users have to install anything?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be web-based, so all you will need is a computer with a
supported browser and an internet connection capable of streaming video.
&lt;a href="https://presentations.akamaized.net/ProductResources/Production/HTML/ComputerTips/ComputerTipsStudio.html"&gt;This page has requirements&lt;/a&gt;
for desktop browser and operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;I booked my air travel already.  Can I get a refund?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're announcing this well ahead of time in the hopes that we reach our
attendees before they've booked travel. Unfortunately, we are unable to
provide a refund for your air travel.  Check with your airline or travel
agency.  Many airlines are waiving change fees or providing credits for
airfare.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ansible.com/blog/ansiblefest-2020-is-now-a-virtual-experience/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
