            <h2>Creating custom Event-Driven Ansible source plugins</h2>
<p>We're surrounded! Our modern systems and applications are constantly
generating events. These events could be generated by service requests,
application events, health checks, etc. With the wealth of information
from event traffic surrounding everything we do, Event-Driven Ansible
allows for automated responses to incoming events.</p>
<p>But not only are we completely engulfed in event data, we're also
enveloped by event sources. Think about your organization or even your
household for a minute and consider how many pieces of equipment or
applications are generating data that could be put to use if only you
were able to easily collect it.</p>
<p>Event source plugins within Event-Driven Ansible act as a bridge between
Ansible and event generating applications and services. Event-Driven
Ansible already has a handful of event plugins to consume events from a
variety of sources. But what if your source plug-in isn't represented in
that list? Or what if you're a Red Hat partner who wants to connect
Event-Driven Ansible to your own solution? The good news is, developing
event source plugins for Event-Driven Ansible can be a relatively
painless endeavor.</p>
<h3>What is a source plugin?</h3>
<p>Event-Driven Ansible leverages rulebooks to codify the response to an
event. Rulebooks combine sources, conditions and actions. An action is
executed based on one or more conditions of an event coming from a
source. Event source plugins allow rulebooks to receive events from
things like cloud services, applications and brokers. Without an event
source, events aren't received and actions aren't taken.</p>
<p>Event sources are Python scripts contained within an Ansible Content
Collection. Within a rulebook, event sources are called by name and
parameters included in the rulebook source configuration are passed into
the event source plugin. Within the event source plugin, routines should
be written as asynchronous to prevent blocking, allowing events to be
received and addressed as efficiently as possible across multiple event
sources. For this reason, you'll notice that all of the initial source
plugins like Kafka and webhook take advantage of the asynchronous IO
paradigm.</p>
<h3>Source plugin guidelines</h3>
<p>Scoping a new event source plugin should be straightforward. For that
reason, there aren't many requirements for the plugin. To get started
with plugin development, here are some guidelines for source plugins:</p>
<ol>
<li>The source plugin <strong>must</strong> contain a specific entry point.</li>
<li>Each source <strong>must</strong> have nested keys which match arguments expected by the main function.</li>
<li>Source plugins should be documented with intended purpose, expected arguments, and a rulebook example.</li>
<li>Event source plugins should be distributed within Collections.</li>
<li>Python routines should be written as non-blocking or asynchronous.</li>
<li>Source plugins should include a way to test the plugin outside of Event-Driven Ansible.</li>
</ol>
<p>To demonstrate some of these guidelines, I'll use an example source
plugin that I created. My source plugin is called new_records and it
watches a table within ServiceNow for new records to be created (e.g.
new incidents, problems and change requests). If you'd like to test
<a href="https://github.com/cloin/snow-demo-setup/tree/main/eda">this source plugin</a>
for yourself, you'll need a ServiceNow instance which you can provision
as part of the <a href="https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do">ServiceNow developer program</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Before</strong> you go out and test my example
plugin, please know that this plugin is coming from a sub-par python
person, is meant to be an example and not at all endorsed or suggested
for production use. ServiceNow instances also have rate limit rules for
REST resources that you may hit by polling too often. Considering that
the event push paradigm is preferred for Event-Driven Ansible source
plugins, a better implementation of this source plugin might be to
create a ServiceNow webservice to push event details to an event
aggregator! In this scenario, our integrated application (ServiceNow)
would PUSH event details to something like JetStream or Kafka (for which
there is already an event source plugin!).</p>
<h3>The source plugin must contain a specific entry point.</h3>
<p>A source plugin requires a pretty specific entrypoint configuration.
This entrypoint represents a function within the Python script that will
be called by ansible-rulebook, the component of Event-Driven Ansible
responsible for executing rulebooks. Let's take a look at the very
beginning of my custom source plugin for ServiceNow:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">asyncio</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">time</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">typing</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Any</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Dict</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">aiohttp</span>

<span class="c1"># Entrypoint from ansible-rulebook</span>
<span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">queue</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">asyncio</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Queue</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Dict</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Any</span><span class="p">]):</span>
</pre></div>

<p>After all of the import statements at the beginning of my plugin, you
can see the entrypoint is an asynchronous function called main, which
accepts two arguments. The first argument is an asyncio queue that will
be consumed by ansible-rulebook as this source is used within a
rulebook. The second argument creates a dictionary of arguments that my
particular source plugin requires to make a connection to my ServiceNow
instance. This dictionary will include things like username, password
and URL for my ServiceNow instance. That's really all that's expected as
far as the entrypoint is concerned. </p>
<h3>Each source must have nested keys which match arguments expected by the main function.</h3>
<p>This is a slightly more complicated way of saying that the arguments I
require within my custom ServiceNow event plugin should also be keys
within the rulebook used to configure the source plugin. To demonstrate
this, look at the source configuration for my custom plugin within a
rulebook and then look at the arguments expected by the main function
that ansible-rulebook executes:</p>
<p><em>Rulebook example:</em></p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">-</span> name: Watch for new records
  hosts: localhost
  sources:
    <span class="k">-</span> cloin.servicenow.new_records:
            instance: https://dev-012345.service-now.com
            username: ansible
            password: ansible
            table: incident
            interval: 1

</pre></div>

<p>As a note, if you're worried about distributing rulebooks with
credentials or other sensitive arguments, <code>ansible-rulebook</code> also
accepts variables set in vars files or from environment variables
using <code>--vars</code> or <code>--env-vars</code> respectively. This would mean
that your rulebook source configuration
could look more like:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="x">- name: Watch for new records</span>
<span class="x">  hosts: localhost</span>
<span class="x">  sources:</span>
<span class="x">    - cloin.servicenow.new_records:</span>
<span class="x">        instance: </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">SN_HOST</span> <span class="cp">}}</span>
<span class="x">        username: </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">SN_USERNAME</span> <span class="cp">}}</span>
<span class="x">        password: </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">SN_PASSWORD</span> <span class="cp">}}</span>
<span class="x">        table: incident</span>
<span class="x">        interval: 1</span>
</pre></div>

<h3>Source plugins should be documented with purpose, expected arguments, and a rulebook example.</h3>
<p>This is sort of a no-brainer that even I, an incredibly sub-par Python
developer, can get on board with. In fact, this is actually one of my
New Year's resolutions for 2023. Take a look at the top of my source
plugin as an example:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="sd">"""</span>
<span class="sd">new_records.py</span>

<span class="sd">Description:</span>
<span class="sd">event-driven-ansible source plugin example</span>
<span class="sd">Poll ServiceNow API for new records in a table</span>
<span class="sd">Only retrieves records created after the script began executing</span>
<span class="sd">This script can be tested outside of ansible-rulebook by specifying</span>
<span class="sd">environment variables for SN_HOST, SN_USERNAME, SN_PASSWORD, SN_TABLE</span>

<span class="sd">Arguments:</span>
<span class="sd">  - instance: ServiceNow instance (e.g. https://dev-012345.service-now.com)</span>
<span class="sd">  - username: ServiceNow username</span>
<span class="sd">  - password: ServiceNow password</span>
<span class="sd">  - table:  Table to watch for new records</span>
<span class="sd">  - query:  (optional) Records to query. Defaults to records created today</span>
<span class="sd">  - interval: (optional) How often to poll for new records. Defaults to 5 seconds</span>

<span class="sd">Usage in a rulebook:</span>
<span class="sd">- name: Watch for new records</span>
<span class="sd">  hosts: localhost</span>
<span class="sd">  sources:</span>
<span class="sd">    - cloin.servicenow.new_records:</span>
<span class="sd">            instance: https://dev-012345.service-now.com</span>
<span class="sd">            username: ansible</span>
<span class="sd">            password: ansible</span>
<span class="sd">            table: incident</span>
<span class="sd">            interval: 1</span>
<span class="sd">  rules:</span>
<span class="sd">    - name: New record created</span>
<span class="sd">      condition: event.sys_id is defined</span>
<span class="sd">      action:</span>
<span class="sd">            debug:</span>
<span class="sd">"""</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Fair enough of a guideline, right? The documentation pretty clearly lays
out that this is an Event-Driven Ansible plugin, what the plugin can be
expected to do, the arguments the plugin accepts and how to use this
plugin within a rulebook. </p>
<h3>Event source plugins should be distributed within Collections.</h3>
<p>Ansible Content Collections represent the model by which Ansible content
can be easily distributed. Typically, these Collections contain things
like plugins, roles, playbooks and documentation, and demonstrate
Ansible's extensibility. Event source plugins and rulebooks become just
additional content types that can be distributed by way of Ansible
Content Collections. This is demonstrated in my plugin documentation
here:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">-</span> name: Watch for new records
  hosts: localhost
  sources:
    <span class="k">-</span> cloin.servicenow.new_records:
            instance: https://dev-012345.service-now.com
</pre></div>

<h3>Python routines should be written as non-blocking or asynchronous.</h3>
<p>The asynchronous model says that, for example, requests against the
ServiceNow API by the new_records source plugin shouldn't block or slow
down requests to another API by another source plugin. By using asyncio
along with async and await within the plugin, we simply pause that one
routine and await a result instead of blocking other routines from
executing. If you combine two source plugins written to utilize only
synchronous routines into the same rulebook, you could find that your
rulebook executes slowly or reacts to events long after they occurred.
Here's an example from my source plugin:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">            async with session.get(f'{instance}/api/now/table/{table}?sysparm_query={query}', auth=auth) as resp:
                if resp.status == 200:

                    records = await resp.json()
                    for record in records['result']:
…
                      await queue.put(record)
</pre></div>

<p>Note the keywords <strong>async</strong> and <strong>await</strong>. The <strong>async</strong> keyword lets
Python know that this coroutine will be executed asynchronously within
an event loop while waiting on the result from whatever has been
"awaited" designated by the <strong>await</strong> keyword, in this case, the
response from the ServiceNow API call.</p>
<p>Another line worth mentioning is the final <strong>await</strong> in the above
snippet of <strong>queue.put(record)</strong>. This is an essential line as this is
how the record can be consumed by the rulebook engine. By putting the
record returned by the ServiceNow API onto the queue, we're able to
execute actions defined in the rulebook  based on the record returned by
the API request.</p>
<h3>Source plugins should include a way to test the plugin outside of Event-Driven Ansible.</h3>
<p>This one really isn't a hard and fast rule for creating source plugins.
I'd say it's more helpful in the plugin development process and may more
resemble a best practice or general tip than anything else. By including
a function that only runs when the script is called directly by running,
for example: python new_records.py, you're able to quickly test changes
to the script without first setting up a rulebook and starting
ansible-rulebook. For my sample plugin, I use the following:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="gh">#</span> this is only called when testing plugin directly, without ansible-rulebook
if __name__ == "__main__":
    instance = os.environ.get('SN_HOST')
    username = os.environ.get('SN_USERNAME')
    password = os.environ.get('SN_PASSWORD')
    table   = os.environ.get('SN_TABLE')

    class MockQueue:
        async def put(self, event):
            print(event)

    asyncio.run(main(MockQueue(), {"instance": instance, "username": username, "password": password, "table": table}))
</pre></div>

<p>If you take a look at that code example, you can see a comment that this
is really just for testing the Python script directly. If you want to
test this code yourself, you can define the four environment variables
(e.g. export SN_TABLE=incident...) and then execute the script. From
there, open up your ServiceNow instance and create a new record in the
table you're watching (in the case of SN_TABLE=incident,  you'd want to
create a new incident) and see that the script prints out the newly
created record.</p>

            <h2>The Zen of Ansible</h2>
<p>This blog post is based on my presentation at AnsibleFest 2022 in
Chicago and <a href="https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/rhaf22/SessionCatalog2022/session/1661879478208001DUNx">virtually</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://github.com/redhat-cop/automation-good-practices/pull/42">a suggestion was made</a>
to adopt <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/">Tim Peters' "The Zen of Python"</a> as an overall guiding principle for
designing good automation content. That gave me pause because it didn't
seem like the right thing to me. While there is definitely some very
good advice to "The Zen of Python" that can be applied to Ansible
content, adopting it in its entirety would not provide the best user
experience that Ansible is capable of and known for. Its presence as a
guiding principle for content design gives the wrong impression and
re-enforces a mindset we don't want to recommend.</p>
<p>This got me thinking, what is "the zen" of Ansible?</p>
<p>I considered the spirit of "The Zen of Python" and then I returned to
the Ansible best practices talk that I first co-presented back in 2016
at Red Hat Summit.
In that talk, I said that Ansible was designed with a philosophy of
sorts from the very beginning.</p>
<p>"The Ansible way" is to provide an automation tool that is simple,
powerful and agentless. Ansible enables users with no special coding
skills to do powerful things across multiple IT domains. Its human
readable automation can be utilized and shared by every IT team so they
can get productive quickly and contribute their expertise. Its agentless
architecture provides the flexibility to be applied across all IT
infrastructure
domains.</p>
<p><img alt="Ansible simple powerful agentless" src="../images/posts/archive/ansible-simple-powerful-agentless.png"></p>
<p>It is this thinking behind its design that everything in this post
relates back to in one way or another.</p>
<p>Besides "The Zen of Python" and my Ansible best practices talk, I also
considered what I've heard talking to hundreds of you in my many years
within the Ansible ecosystem. What I came up with are these 20 aphorisms
for Ansible.</p>
<p><img alt="Ansible zen image" src="../images/posts/archive/ZenOfAnsibleEmoji.png"></p>
<ol>
<li>Ansible is not Python.</li>
<li>YAML sucks for coding.</li>
<li>Playbooks are not for programming.</li>
<li>Ansible users are (most likely) not programmers.</li>
<li>Clear is better than cluttered.</li>
<li>Concise is better than verbose.</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
<li>Readability counts.</li>
<li>Helping users get things done matters most.</li>
<li>User experience beats ideological purity.</li>
<li>"Magic" conquers the manual.</li>
<li>When giving users options, use convention over configuration.</li>
<li>Declarative is better than imperative -- most of the time.</li>
<li>Focus avoids complexity.</li>
<li>Complexity kills productivity.</li>
<li>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</li>
<li>Every shell command and UI interaction is an opportunity to automate.</li>
<li>Just because something works, doesn't mean it can't be improved.</li>
<li>Friction should be eliminated whenever possible.</li>
<li>Automation is a journey that never ends.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your Ansible automation content doesn't necessarily have to follow this
guidance, but they're good ideas to keep in mind. These aphorisms are
opinions that can be debated and sometimes can be contradictory. What
matters is that they communicate a mindset for getting the most from
Ansible and your automation.</p>
<p>Let me take you deeper into each of the aphorisms and explain what they
mean to your automation practice.</p>
<p><strong>Ansible is not Python. YAML sucks for coding. Playbooks are not for programming. Ansible users are (most probably) not programmers.</strong></p>
<p>These aphorisms are at the heart of why applying guidelines for a
programming language to good Ansible automation content didn't seem
right to me. As I said, it would give the wrong impression and would
reinforce a mindset we don't recommend -- that Ansible is a programming
language for coding your playbooks. </p>
<p>These aphorisms are all saying the same thing in different ways --
certainly the first 3. If you're trying to "write code" in your plays
and roles, you're setting yourself up for failure. Ansible's YAML-based
playbooks were never meant to be for programming.</p>
<p>So it bothers me when I see Python-isms bleeding into what Ansible users
see and do. It may be natural and make sense if you write code in
Python, but most Ansible users are not Pythonistas. So, it can be
challenging and confusing when these isms are incorporated, thereby
introducing friction that degrades their user experience and the value
that Ansible provides. </p>
<p>By Ansible not being a programming language, all parts of your
organization can contribute to automating your entire IT stack rather
than relying on skill programmers to understand your operations to write
and maintain code for it.</p>
<p>If you are a programmer creating Ansible modules and plugins, assume you
are not the target audience for what you are developing and your target
audience won't have the same skills and resources you possess.</p>
<p><strong>Clear is better than cluttered. Concise is better than verbose. Simple is better than complex. Readability counts.</strong></p>
<p>These are really just interpretations of aphorisms in "The Zen of
Python". The last one is taken directly from it because you can't
improve on perfection.</p>
<p>In the original Ansible best practices talk, we recommended users
optimize for readability. This holds true even more so today. If done
properly, your content can be the documentation of your workflow
automation. Take the time to make your automation as clear and concise
as possible. Iterate over what you create and always look for
opportunities to simplify and clarify.</p>
<p>These aphorisms don't just apply to those writing playbooks and creating
roles. If you are a module developer, think about how your work can
assist users, be clear and concise, do things simply and just get things
done.</p>
<p><strong>Helping users get things done matters most. User experience beats ideological purity.</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are creating modules, plugins and collections or writing
playbooks or designing a cross domain hybrid automation workflow --
Ansible is for helping you get things done. Always consider and look to
maximize the user experience. Don't get caught up and beholden to some
strict interpretation of standards or ideological purity that shifts the
burden on the end user. </p>
<p><strong>"Magic" conquers the manual.</strong></p>
<p>Arthur C. Clarke wrote, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic."</p>
<p>The "magic" in Ansible is its playbook engine and module system. It is
how Ansible provides powerful and flexible capabilities in a
straightforward and accessible way by abstracting users from all of the
complex implementation details that lie beneath. This frees users from
doing time consuming and error prone manual operations or writing
brittle one-off scripts and code, enabling them the time to put their
valuable expertise to use where it is needed.</p>
<p>Design automation that amazes users can make difficult or tedious tasks
easy and almost effortless. Look to provide powerful time saving
capabilities that are quick to deploy and utilize them to get things
done.</p>
<p><strong>When giving users options, use convention over configuration.</strong></p>
<p>I am a big proponent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">convention over configuration</a>
and don't think it gets enough consideration in the Ansible community.
Convention over configuration is a design paradigm that attempts to
decrease the number of decisions that a developer is required to make
without necessarily losing flexibility so they don't have to repeat
themselves. It was popularized by Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>A playbook developer utilizing your work should only need to specify
unique and unconventional aspects of their automation tasks and
workflows and no more. Look to reduce the number of decisions and
implementation details a user needs to make. Take the time to handle the
most common use cases for them. Look to provide as many sensible
defaults with modules, plugins and roles as possible. Optimize for users
to get things done quickly. </p>
<p><strong>Declarative is better than imperative -- most of the time.</strong></p>
<p>This aphorism is particularly for Ansible Content Collection developers.
Ansible is a desired state engine by design. Think declaratively first.
If there truly is no way to design something declaratively, then use
imperative (procedural) means. </p>
<p>Declarative means that configuration is guaranteed by a set of facts
instead of by a set of instructions, for example, "there should be 10
RHEL servers", rather than "depending on how many RHEL servers are
running, start/stop servers until you have 10, and tell me if it worked
or not". </p>
<p>This aphorism is an example of the "user experience beats ideological
purity" aphorism in practice. Rather than strictly adhering to a
declarative approach to automation, Ansible incorporates declarative and
imperative means. This mix offers you the flexibility to focus on what
you need to do, rather than strictly adhere to one paradigm.</p>
<p><strong>Focus avoids complexity. Complexity kills productivity.</strong></p>
<p>Remember that complexity kills productivity. The Ansible team at Red Hat
really means it and believes that. That's not just a marketing slogan.
Automation can crush complexity and give you the one thing you can't get
enough of ⎯ time. </p>
<p>Follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20Unix%20philosophy,that%20is%20a%20universal%20interface.">Linux principles of doing one thing, and one thing well</a>.
Keep roles and playbooks focused on a specific purpose. Multiple simple
ones are better than having a huge single playbook full of conditionals
and "programming" that Ansible is not well suited for.</p>
<p>We strive to reduce complexity in how we've designed Ansible and
encourage you to do the same. Strive for simplification in what you
automate. </p>
<p><strong>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</strong></p>
<p>This aphorism, like "readability counts", is also taken directly from
"The Zen of Python" because you cannot improve upon perfection.</p>
<p>In his essay on <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html">Literate Programming, Charles Knuth</a> wrote,
"Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what
to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we
want a computer to do." So it goes that if you cannot explain or
document your implementation easily, then it's a bad idea that needs to
be rethought or scrapped. If it is hard to explain, what chance do
others have of understanding it, using it and debugging it? <a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws#kernighans-law">Kernighan's
Law</a> says
"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by
definition, not smart enough to debug it."</p>
<p>Ansible is designed for how real people think and work. Recall earlier
when I said Ansible Playbooks are human readable automation with no
special coding skills needed. Take advantage of that. Then, if you are
having trouble explaining what you are trying to do, pause and
re-consider your implementation and the process you are trying to
automate. How can I make it easier to explain? Can my process be
improved or streamlined? How can I simplify and clarify? Can I break it
down into smaller more focused parts and iterate over this? </p>
<p>This will help you identify a bad idea sooner and avoid the types of
friction that will slow down you and your organization over time.</p>
<p><strong>Every shell command and UI interaction is an opportunity to automate.</strong></p>
<p>This aphorism comes from my personal experience talking about Ansible
and automation for many years. Sometimes I am asked what they should
automate. Other times, I am challenged that an automation tool like
Ansible is unnecessary or does not apply to what they are doing. No
matter if we were talking about RHEL, Windows, networking
infrastructure, security, edge devices, or cloud services, my response
has essentially been the same over the years. I have repeated it so
often, that I have jokingly formulated the point into my own theorem on
automation. So call it "Appnel's Theorem on Automation" if you will.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what should be automated, look for anything anyone
is typing into a Linux shell and clicking through in a user interface.
Then ask yourself "is this something that can be automated?" Then ask
"what is the value of automating this?" Most Ansible modules wrap
command line tools or use the same APIs behind UIs.</p>
<p>Given a sufficient number of things to automate is identified, start
with those that cause the most pain and those that you can get done
quickly. Remember you want to create a virtuous cycle of releasing
reliability, feedback and building trust across your organization.
Showing progress and business value quickly will help do that.</p>
<p><strong>Just because something works, doesn't mean it can't be improved. Friction should be eliminated whenever possible.</strong></p>
<p>This first aphorism just so happens to be a quote from the movie Black
Panther, and it elegantly expresses some important wisdom when it comes
to Ansible automation.</p>
<p>Always iterate and adapt to real world feedback from your operations.
Optimize readability. Continue to find ways to simplify and reduce
friction in your organization and its processes. As changes are
introduced into your environments and IT policies over time, they will
create new friction and pain points. They will also create new
opportunities to apply your automation practices to eliminate them.</p>
<p><strong>Automation is a journey that never ends.</strong></p>
<p>Heraclitus, a Greek philosopher, said "change is the only constant in
life. Nothing endures but change." </p>
<p>Anyone who has been around the IT industry for any length of time knows
there is constant change. This is why it is so vital to be agile and
prepared to respond to ongoing change, innovation and business demands
quickly and reliably. </p>
<p>Automation is not a destination. It is a practice. It is a culture, a
mindset and an attitude. Automation is a continuous process of feedback
and learning and adapting to change and improving upon what you did
before. </p>
<p>Automation creates opportunities and we at Red Hat see opportunities for
automation everywhere. </p>
<p>So the question I pose to you is: Where will your automation journey
lead you?</p>

Ansible and its origins, I recommend these resources.</p>
<p>The Ansible Community of Practice (CoP) has assembled
<a href="https://redhat-cop.github.io/automation-good-practices/">a comprehensive repository of "good practices" for Ansible content development</a>.
The <a href="https://ansible-lint.readthedocs.io/">Ansible Lint tool</a> has now
been added to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and codifies many
of these practices in rules and profiles to help you quickly identify
and enforce consistent application to your work.</p>
