<h2>Creating custom Event-Driven Ansible source plugins</h2>
<p>We're surrounded! Our modern systems and applications are constantly
generating events. These events could be generated by service requests,
application events, health checks, etc. With the wealth of information
from event traffic surrounding everything we do, Event-Driven Ansible
allows for automated responses to incoming events.</p>
<p>But not only are we completely engulfed in event data, we're also
enveloped by event sources. Think about your organization or even your
household for a minute and consider how many pieces of equipment or
applications are generating data that could be put to use if only you
were able to easily collect it.</p>
<p>Event source plugins within Event-Driven Ansible act as a bridge between
Ansible and event generating applications and services. Event-Driven
Ansible already has a handful of event plugins to consume events from a
variety of sources. But what if your source plug-in isn't represented in
that list? Or what if you're a Red Hat partner who wants to connect
Event-Driven Ansible to your own solution? The good news is, developing
event source plugins for Event-Driven Ansible can be a relatively
painless endeavor.</p>
<h3>What is a source plugin?</h3>
<p>Event-Driven Ansible leverages rulebooks to codify the response to an
event. Rulebooks combine sources, conditions and actions. An action is
executed based on one or more conditions of an event coming from a
source. Event source plugins allow rulebooks to receive events from
things like cloud services, applications and brokers. Without an event
source, events aren't received and actions aren't taken.</p>
<p>Event sources are Python scripts contained within an Ansible Content
Collection. Within a rulebook, event sources are called by name and
parameters included in the rulebook source configuration are passed into
the event source plugin. Within the event source plugin, routines should
be written as asynchronous to prevent blocking, allowing events to be
received and addressed as efficiently as possible across multiple event
sources. For this reason, you'll notice that all of the initial source
plugins like Kafka and webhook take advantage of the asynchronous IO
paradigm.</p>
<h3>Source plugin guidelines</h3>
<p>Scoping a new event source plugin should be straightforward. For that
reason, there aren't many requirements for the plugin. To get started
with plugin development, here are some guidelines for source plugins:</p>
<ol>
<li>The source plugin <strong>must</strong> contain a specific entry point.</li>
<li>Each source <strong>must</strong> have nested keys which match arguments expected by the main function.</li>
<li>Source plugins should be documented with intended purpose, expected arguments, and a rulebook example.</li>
<li>Event source plugins should be distributed within Collections.</li>
<li>Python routines should be written as non-blocking or asynchronous.</li>
<li>Source plugins should include a way to test the plugin outside of Event-Driven Ansible.</li>
</ol>
<p>To demonstrate some of these guidelines, I'll use an example source
plugin that I created. My source plugin is called new_records and it
watches a table within ServiceNow for new records to be created (e.g.
new incidents, problems and change requests). If you'd like to test
<a href="https://github.com/cloin/snow-demo-setup/tree/main/eda">this source plugin</a>
for yourself, you'll need a ServiceNow instance which you can provision
as part of the <a href="https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do">ServiceNow developer program</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Before</strong> you go out and test my example
plugin, please know that this plugin is coming from a sub-par python
person, is meant to be an example and not at all endorsed or suggested
for production use. ServiceNow instances also have rate limit rules for
REST resources that you may hit by polling too often. Considering that
the event push paradigm is preferred for Event-Driven Ansible source
plugins, a better implementation of this source plugin might be to
create a ServiceNow webservice to push event details to an event
aggregator! In this scenario, our integrated application (ServiceNow)
would PUSH event details to something like JetStream or Kafka (for which
there is already an event source plugin!).</p>
<h3>The source plugin must contain a specific entry point.</h3>
<p>A source plugin requires a pretty specific entrypoint configuration.
This entrypoint represents a function within the Python script that will
be called by ansible-rulebook, the component of Event-Driven Ansible
responsible for executing rulebooks. Let's take a look at the very
beginning of my custom source plugin for ServiceNow:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">asyncio</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">time</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">typing</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Any</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Dict</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">aiohttp</span>

<span class="c1"># Entrypoint from ansible-rulebook</span>
<span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">queue</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">asyncio</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Queue</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Dict</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Any</span><span class="p">]):</span>
</pre></div>

<p>After all of the import statements at the beginning of my plugin, you
can see the entrypoint is an asynchronous function called main, which
accepts two arguments. The first argument is an asyncio queue that will
be consumed by ansible-rulebook as this source is used within a
rulebook. The second argument creates a dictionary of arguments that my
particular source plugin requires to make a connection to my ServiceNow
instance. This dictionary will include things like username, password
and URL for my ServiceNow instance. That's really all that's expected as
far as the entrypoint is concerned. </p>
<h3>Each source must have nested keys which match arguments expected by the main function.</h3>
<p>This is a slightly more complicated way of saying that the arguments I
require within my custom ServiceNow event plugin should also be keys
within the rulebook used to configure the source plugin. To demonstrate
this, look at the source configuration for my custom plugin within a
rulebook and then look at the arguments expected by the main function
that ansible-rulebook executes:</p>
<p><em>Rulebook example:</em></p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">-</span> name: Watch for new records
  hosts: localhost
  sources:
    <span class="k">-</span> cloin.servicenow.new_records:
            instance: https://dev-012345.service-now.com
            username: ansible
            password: ansible
            table: incident
            interval: 1
</pre></div>

</pre></div>

<p>As a note, if you're worried about distributing rulebooks with
credentials or other sensitive arguments, <code>ansible-rulebook</code> also
accepts variables set in vars files or from environment variables
using <code>--vars</code> or <code>--env-vars</code> respectively. This would mean
that your rulebook source configuration
could look more like:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="x">- name: Watch for new records</span>
<span class="x">  hosts: localhost</span>
<span class="x">  sources:</span>
<span class="x">    - cloin.servicenow.new_records:</span>
<span class="x">        instance: </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">SN_HOST</span> <span class="cp">}}</span>
<span class="x">        username: </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">SN_USERNAME</span> <span class="cp">}}</span>
<span class="x">        password: </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">SN_PASSWORD</span> <span class="cp">}}</span>
<span class="x">        table: incident</span>
<span class="x">        interval: 1</span>
</pre></div>

<h3>Source plugins should be documented with purpose, expected arguments, and a rulebook example.</h3>
<p>This is sort of a no-brainer that even I, an incredibly sub-par Python
developer, can get on board with. In fact, this is actually one of my
New Year's resolutions for 2023. Take a look at the top of my source
plugin as an example:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="sd">"""</span>
<span class="sd">new_records.py</span>

<span class="sd">Description:</span>
<span class="sd">event-driven-ansible source plugin example</span>
<span class="sd">Poll ServiceNow API for new records in a table</span>
<span class="sd">Only retrieves records created after the script began executing</span>
<span class="sd">This script can be tested outside of ansible-rulebook by specifying</span>
<span class="sd">environment variables for SN_HOST, SN_USERNAME, SN_PASSWORD, SN_TABLE</span>

<span class="sd">Arguments:</span>
<span class="sd">  - instance: ServiceNow instance (e.g. https://dev-012345.service-now.com)</span>
<span class="sd">  - username: ServiceNow username</span>
<span class="sd">  - password: ServiceNow password</span>
<span class="sd">  - table:  Table to watch for new records</span>
<span class="sd">  - query:  (optional) Records to query. Defaults to records created today</span>
<span class="sd">  - interval: (optional) How often to poll for new records. Defaults to 5 seconds</span>

<span class="sd">Usage in a rulebook:</span>
<span class="sd">- name: Watch for new records</span>
<span class="sd">  hosts: localhost</span>
<span class="sd">  sources:</span>
<span class="sd">    - cloin.servicenow.new_records:</span>
<span class="sd">            instance: https://dev-012345.service-now.com</span>
<span class="sd">            username: ansible</span>
<span class="sd">            password: ansible</span>
<span class="sd">            table: incident</span>
<span class="sd">            interval: 1</span>
<span class="sd">  rules:</span>
<span class="sd">    - name: New record created</span>
<span class="sd">      condition: event.sys_id is defined</span>
<span class="sd">      action:</span>
<span class="sd">            debug:</span>
<span class="sd">"""</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Fair enough of a guideline, right? The documentation pretty clearly lays
out that this is an Event-Driven Ansible plugin, what the plugin can be
expected to do, the arguments the plugin accepts and how to use this
plugin within a rulebook. </p>
<h3>Event source plugins should be distributed within Collections.</h3>
<p>Ansible Content Collections represent the model by which Ansible content
can be easily distributed. Typically, these Collections contain things
like plugins, roles, playbooks and documentation, and demonstrate
Ansible's extensibility. Event source plugins and rulebooks become just
additional content types that can be distributed by way of Ansible
Content Collections. This is demonstrated in my plugin documentation
here:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">-</span> name: Watch for new records
  hosts: localhost
  sources:
    <span class="k">-</span> cloin.servicenow.new_records:
            instance: https://dev-012345.service-now.com
</pre></div>

<h3>Python routines should be written as non-blocking or asynchronous.</h3>
<p>The asynchronous model says that, for example, requests against the
ServiceNow API by the new_records source plugin shouldn't block or slow
down requests to another API by another source plugin. By using asyncio
along with async and await within the plugin, we simply pause that one
routine and await a result instead of blocking other routines from
executing. If you combine two source plugins written to utilize only
synchronous routines into the same rulebook, you could find that your
rulebook executes slowly or reacts to events long after they occurred.
Here's an example from my source plugin:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">            async with session.get(f'{instance}/api/now/table/{table}?sysparm_query={query}', auth=auth) as resp:
                if resp.status == 200:

                    records = await resp.json()
                    for record in records['result']:
…
                      await queue.put(record)
</pre></div>

<p>Note the keywords <strong>async</strong> and <strong>await</strong>. The <strong>async</strong> keyword lets
Python know that this coroutine will be executed asynchronously within
an event loop while waiting on the result from whatever has been
"awaited" designated by the <strong>await</strong> keyword, in this case, the
response from the ServiceNow API call.</p>
<p>Another line worth mentioning is the final <strong>await</strong> in the above
snippet of <strong>queue.put(record)</strong>. This is an essential line as this is
how the record can be consumed by the rulebook engine. By putting the
record returned by the ServiceNow API onto the queue, we're able to
execute actions defined in the rulebook  based on the record returned by
the API request.</p>
<h3>Source plugins should include a way to test the plugin outside of Event-Driven Ansible.</h3>
<p>This one really isn't a hard and fast rule for creating source plugins.
I'd say it's more helpful in the plugin development process and may more
resemble a best practice or general tip than anything else. By including
a function that only runs when the script is called directly by running,
for example: python new_records.py, you're able to quickly test changes
to the script without first setting up a rulebook and starting
ansible-rulebook. For my sample plugin, I use the following:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="gh">#</span> this is only called when testing plugin directly, without ansible-rulebook
if __name__ == "__main__":
    instance = os.environ.get('SN_HOST')
    username = os.environ.get('SN_USERNAME')
    password = os.environ.get('SN_PASSWORD')
    table   = os.environ.get('SN_TABLE')

    class MockQueue:
        async def put(self, event):
            print(event)

<p>If you take a look at that code example, you can see a comment that this
is really just for testing the Python script directly. If you want to
test this code yourself, you can define the four environment variables
(e.g. export SN_TABLE=incident...) and then execute the script. From
there, open up your ServiceNow instance and create a new record in the
table you're watching (in the case of SN_TABLE=incident,  you'd want to
create a new incident) and see that the script prints out the newly
created record.</p>
