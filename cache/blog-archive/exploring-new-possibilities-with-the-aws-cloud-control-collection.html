<h1>Exploring New Possibilities with the AWS Cloud Control Collection</h1>
<p>We recently made available an experimental alpha Collection of
generated modules using the AWS Cloud Control API for interacting with
AWS Services. This content is not intended for production in its current
state. We are making this work available because we thought it was
important to share our research and get your
feedback.</p>
<p>In this post, we'll highlight how to try out this alpha release of the
new <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.cloud">amazon.cloud content Collection</a></p>
<h2>The AWS Cloud Control API</h2>
<p>Launched in September 2021 and featured at AWS re:Invent, AWS Cloud
Control API is a set of common application programming interfaces (APIs)
that provides five operations for developers to create, read, update,
delete, and list (CRUDL) resources and make it easy for developers and
partners to manage the lifecycle of AWS and third-party services in a
standard way.</p>
<p>The Cloud Control API provides support for hundreds of AWS resources
today with support for more existing AWS resources across services such
as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage
Service (Amazon S3) in the coming months.</p>
<p>AWS delivers a broad and deep portfolio of cloud services. It started
with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and grew over 200+
services. Each distinct AWS service has a specific API with its own
vocabulary, input parameters, and error reporting. As these APIs are
unique to each service, developers have to understand the behavior
(input, responses, and error codes) of each API they use. As
applications have become increasingly sophisticated and developers work
across more AWS services, it can become challenging to learn and manage
distinct APIs for developers.</p>
<p>With the launch of AWS Cloud Control API, developers have a consistent
method to manage supported services that are defined as part of their
cloud infrastructure throughout their lifecycle, so there are fewer APIs
to learn as developers add new services to their
infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Why AWS Cloud Control API is important to Ansible</h2>
<p>While not directly affecting Ansible content authors automating AWS
services, we believe the Cloud Control API will be beneficial in
providing a better cloud automation experience.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy is that it enables the
rapid introduction of new AWS services and
implementation of new features to existing ones. This will also enable
more comprehensive coverage of the vast number of AWS services
available. This can be further extended to include third-party services
running in the AWS cloud that have adopted the Cloud Control
API.</p>
<p>The modules contained in this Collection are generated using a tool
called <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon_cloud_code_generator">amazon_cloud_code_generator</a> -
developed and open sourced by the Ansible Cloud
team.</p>
<p><img alt="amazon.cloud collection generation flow diagram" src="/images/posts/archive/aws-ansible-cloud-collection.jpg"></p>
<p>As you can see in the flow diagram, the Collection can be easily
deployed using <code>tox -e refresh_modules</code>, and it is generated in the
<code>cloud</code> subdirectory by default.</p>
<p>Basically, the generation process leverages some Python utility scripts
that wrap the AWS CloudFormation client to scrape Resource Type
Definition Schema or meta-schema for each Amazon-supported resource and
performs the necessary processing to generate module 
documentation.</p>
<p>Additional processing logic generates all utilities including modules,
modules_utils, and tests.</p>
<p>For example, <code>module_utils</code> contains a base class that can be used by all resource modules to
provide all the necessary methods to create, update, delete, describe
and list with the appropriate logic to wait, paginate, and gracefully
handle botocore exceptions. </p>
<h2>Using the amazon.cloud Collection</h2>
<p>All the modules of this Collection use boto3
Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software
Development Kit (SDK) for Python and AWS
Cloud Control API (CloudControlApi) client. It
requires:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/boto/boto3">boto3</a> <code>&gt;=</code> 1.20.0 and <a href="https://github.com/boto/botocore">botocore</a> <code>&gt;=</code> 1.23.0</li>
<li>Python 3.9 or higher.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The basic task example</h2>
<p>Let's take a look at a practical example of how to use the amazon.cloud
Collection. Perhaps you need to provision a simple AWS S3 bucket and
then describe it.</p>
<p>If you are already using the
<a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws"><code>amazon.aws</code></a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws"><code>community.aws</code></a>
Collections, you can see the tasks syntax is pretty much
similar.</p>
<p>You may notice that we no longer have
<code>info</code> modules,
but the "get" or "describe" and "list" features that the
<code>info</code> modules
were doing are handled in the main module. This certainly simplifies the
Collection usage and improves user experience.</p>

</pre></div>

<p>Another relevant feature of the amazon.cloud content Collection is the
structure of the returned result. Particularly, the result returned by
all the available operations (present, absent, list and get or describe)
is well-structured and uniform across all the modules. It always
contains the identifier of the resource and a dictionary of
resource-specific properties. </p>
<p>In this way, we can straightforwardly get the identifier of each
resource and re-use it in multiple dependent resources.</p>
<p>This feature has definitely a positive impact on the user experience.</p>

<h2>Known issues and shortcomings</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Generated modules like these are only as good as the API and its
    schema. Documentation may not be complete for all the modules
    options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missing supportability for important AWS resources like, EC2
    instance, volume and snapshot, RDS instance and snapshot, Elastic
    Load Balancer, etc. Resources from some of these AWS services are
    expected to be supported in the coming months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idempotency (desired state) is a function of the API and may not be
    fully supported. In the Cloud Control API, the idempotency is
    achieved using the <code>ClientToken</code>. A
    <code>ClientToken</code>, which is valid for 36 hours
    once used. </p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>After that, a resource request with the same client token is
        treated as a new request. </li>
<li>To overcome this limitation, the modules present in this
    Collection handle the idempotency by performing a first
    <code>get_resource(TypeName='', Identifier='')</code> operation using the
    resource identifier. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missing server-side pagination may have a severe impact on
    performance. As you may know, some AWS operations return results
    that are incomplete and require subsequent requests in order to
    attain the entire result set. Paginators are a feature of boto3 that
    act as an abstraction over the process of iterating over an entire
    result set of a truncated API operation. Cloud Control API lacks
    this functionality at the moment. This limitation is handled in this
    Collection by implementing manual client-side paginators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filtering to provide name based identification to support desired
    state (idempotency) logic like in amazon.aws is absent. In practice
    it means you cannot list all the resources and filter the result on
    the server-side. </p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>For example, several modules do not allow the user to set a
        primaryIdentifier at creation time. One possible solution would
        be to allow the user to set a resource name and use that name to
        set [Tag:Name, but as the API does
        not allow server-side resource filtering, we can only implement
        a client-side filtering using that tag information. This
        approach would definitely have a severe impact on performance. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not all the resources support the available states. In practice this
    means that some resources cannot be updated or listed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is next?</h2>
<p>The new amazon.cloud auto-generated Collection, besides the fact that it
can be easily generated using the generator tool and has a pretty
abstract set of APIs for all modules, is very straightforward to use and
to re-use resources across multiple dependent resources.</p>
<p>We continually strive to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a Collection\'s API generated modules more usable and easier to
    work with. </li>
<li>Increase resource supportability and cover wider use case scenarios
    more quickly.</li>
<li>Improve the overall Collection module's performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>What can we do to improve provisioning AWS cloud resources with Ansible?
More broadly, what can we do to make API generated modules more usable
and easier to work with? We'd like to hear what you think.</p>
<p>You can provide feedback by reporting any issue against the
<a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.cloud/issues.">amazon.cloud GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>Because the modules are auto-generated, you can contribute with GitHub
Pull Requests by opening them against the
<a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon_cloud_code_generator">amazon_cloud_code_generator</a>
tool and not the resulting Collection.</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>Although in its alpha version, the new amazon.cloud content Collection
shows enormous potential for automating your deployments on AWS with
Ansible and greatly increasing the chances of your cloud initiative
being successful. </p>
<p>We hope you found this blog post helpful! But, more importantly, we hope
it inspired you to try out the latest amazon.cloud Collection release
and let us know what you think.</p>
