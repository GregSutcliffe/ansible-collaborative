<h1>Ansible and ServiceNow Part 3, Making outbound RESTful API calls to Red Hat Ansible Tower</h1>
<p>Red Hat Ansible Tower offers value by allowing automation to scale in a
checked manner - users can run playbooks for only the processes and
targets they need access to, and no further. </p>
<p>Not only does Ansible Tower provide automation at scale, but it also
integrates with several external platforms. In many cases, this means
that users can use the interface they are accustomed to while launching
Ansible Tower templates in the background. </p>
<p>One of the most ubiquitous self service platforms in use today is
ServiceNow, and many of the enterprise conversations had with Ansible
Tower customers focus on ServiceNow integration. With this in mind, this
blog entry walks through the steps to set up your ServiceNow instance to
make outbound RESTful API calls into Ansible Tower, using OAuth2
authentication.</p>
<p>The following software versions are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ansible Tower: 3.4, 3.5</li>
<li>ServiceNow: London, Madrid</li>
</ul>
<p>If you sign up for a ServiceNow Developer account, ServiceNow offers a
free instance that can be used for replicating and testing this
functionality. Your ServiceNow instance needs to be able to reach your
Ansible Tower instance. Additionally, you can visit
<a href="https://ansible.com/license">https://ansible.com/license</a> to obtain a trial license for Ansible
Tower. Instructions for installing Ansible Tower can be found
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/quickinstall/prepare.html">here</a>. </p>

<li>The only HTTP Header that should be required is <em>Content-Type: application/json</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can kick off a RESTful call to Ansible Tower using these parameters
with the <strong>Test</strong> link.</p>
<p><img alt="image6-3" src="/images/posts/archive/image6-3.png"></p>
<h2>Testing connectivity between ServiceNow and Ansible Tower</h2>
<p>Clicking the <strong>Test</strong> link will take you to a results screen, which
should indicate that the Restful call was sent successfully to Ansible
Tower. In this example, ServiceNow kicks off an Ansible Tower job
Template, and the response includes the Job ID in Ansible Tower: 276.</p>
<p><img alt="image eight" src="/images/posts/archive/image-88.png"></p>
<p>You can confirm that this Job Template was in fact started by going back
to Ansible Tower and clicking the <strong>Jobs</strong> section on the left side of
the screen; a Job with the same ID should be in the list (and, depending
on the playbook size, may still be in process):</p>
<p><img alt="image15" src="/images/posts/archive/image15.png"></p>
<h2>Creating a ServiceNow Catalog Item to Launch an Ansible Tower Job Template</h2>
<p>Now that you are able to make outbound RESTful calls from
ServiceNow to Ansible Tower, it's time to create a catalog item for
users to select in ServiceNow in a production self-service fashion.
While in the HTTP Method options, click the <strong>Preview Script Usage</strong>
link:</p>
<p><img alt="image nine" src="/images/posts/archive/image-99.png"></p>
<p>Copy the resulting script the appears, and paste it into a text editor
to reference later.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In ServiceNow, navigate to <strong>Workflow -&gt; Workflow Editor.</strong> This
will open a new tab with a list of all existing ServiceNow workflows.
Click on the blue <strong>New Workflow</strong> button:</p>
<p><img alt="image16" src="/images/posts/archive/image16.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>New Workflow</strong> dialog box that appears, fill in the
following options:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name: A descriptive name of the workflow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Table: Requested Item <code>sc_req_item</code></p>
<p>Everything else can be left alone. Click the <strong>Submit</strong> button.</p>
<p><img alt="image1-10" src="/images/posts/archive/image1-10.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The resulting Workflow Editor will have only a Begin and End box.
Click on the line (it will turn blue to indicate it has been selected),
then press delete to get rid of it.</p>
<p><img alt="image14-1" src="/images/posts/archive/image14-1.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the right side of the Workflow Editor Screen, select the Core
tab and, under Core Activities-&gt;Utilities, drag the Run Script option
into the Workflow Editor. In the new dialog box that appears, type in a
descriptive name, and paste in the script you captured from before.
Click Submit to save the Script.</p>
<p><img alt="image12-1" src="/images/posts/archive/image12-1.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw a connection from <strong>Begin</strong>, to the newly created Run Script
Box, and another from the <strong>Run Script</strong> box to <strong>End</strong>. Afterward,
click on the three horizontal lines to the left of the Workflow name,
and select the <strong>Publish</strong> option. You are now ready to associate this
workflow with a catalog item.</p>
<p><img alt="image8-1" src="/images/posts/archive/image8-1.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate to <strong>Service Catalog -&gt; Catalog Definitions -&gt; Maintain Items</strong>. Click the blue <strong>New</strong> button on the resulting item list. In
the resulting dialog box, fill in the following fields:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name: Descriptive name of the Catalog Item</p>
</li>
<li>Catalog: The catalog that this item should be a part of</li>
<li>
<p>Category: Required if you wish users to be able to search for this
    item</p>
<p>In the Process Engine tab, populate the <strong>Workflow</strong> field with the Workflow you just created.
Click the Submit Button.
You've not created a new catalog item!</p>
<p><img alt="image5-4" src="/images/posts/archive/image5-4.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, to run this catalog item, navigate to
<strong>Self-Service -&gt; Homepage</strong> and search for the catalog item you just
created. Once found, click the <strong>order now</strong> button. You can see the
results page pop up in ServiceNow, and you can confirm that the Job is
being run in Ansible Tower.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations! After completing these steps, you can now use a
ServiceNow Catalog Item to launch Job and Workflow Templates in Ansible
Tower. This is ideal for allowing end users to use a front end they are
familiar with in order to perform automated tasks of varying
complexities. This familiarity goes a long way toward reducing the time
to value for the enterprise as a whole, rather than just the teams
responsible for writing the playbooks being used.</p>
