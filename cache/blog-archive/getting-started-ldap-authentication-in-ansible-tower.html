<h1>Getting Started with LDAP Authentication in Ansible Tower</h1>
<p>Next in the Getting Started series is
covering the basics of configuring Red Hat Ansible Tower to allow users
to log in with LDAP credentials. In this post, we'll explain a few
troubleshooting tips to help narrow down problems and correct them. As
long as you have a map of your LDAP tree/forest, this post should help
get users logging in with their LDAP credentials.</p>
<h2>CONFIGURATION SETTINGS</h2>
<p>To configure your Ansible Tower for LDAP authentication, navigate to
Settings (the gear icon) and to the "Configure Tower" section. The
area within these configuration settings we're focusing on is
"Authentication", and the sub category should be set to "LDAP".</p>
<p><img alt="Ansible-Getting-Started-Tower-LDAP-7" src="/images/posts/archive/Ansible-Getting-Started-Tower-LDAP-7.png"></p>
<p>The fields that will be the primary focus are:</p>
<ul>
<li>LDAP server URI</li>
<li>Bind DN and password</li>
<li>User/group searches</li>
</ul>
<p>The other fields will allow you to refine your LDAP searches to reduce
the resources used in production or map your organization.</p>
<p><strong>The LDAP URI</strong> is simply the IP or hostname of your LDAP server
prepended with the protocol (<code>ldap://</code>).</p>
<p><img alt="Ansible-Getting-Started-Tower-LDAP-8" src="/images/posts/archive/Ansible-Getting-Started-Tower-LDAP-8.png">\</p>
<p><strong>The bind DN</strong> will be a user credential and password (followed by the
group and domain) with access to read the LDAP structure.</p>

<h2>REFINING USER SEARCH</h2>
<p>With Ansible Tower able to connect to the LDAP server, refining the user
search completes the configuration. The User Search entry will match the
pattern specified by location and scope. In this case the user ID is the
sAMAccountName value (instead of uid) since the search is against an
Active Directory tree.</p>

<h2>USER AND GROUP SEARCH</h2>
<p>The User and Group searches are where the most troubleshooting might
have to be done, depending on how complex your directory structure is.
Use the ldapsearch tool from the openldap package to construct searches
against the LDAP server. Begin with a basic search and dive
incrementally to refine your searches.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ldapsearch -x  -H ldap://10.10.10.254 -D &quot;CN=jarvis,CN=Users,DC=shield,DC=team&quot; -w 01Password! -b &quot;cn=Users,dc=shield,dc=team&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>This search is general and will list results in the location specified
<code>(-b "cn=Users,dc=shield,dc=team")</code> with the location
matching what you would use for your LDAP search scope against your
server.</p>
<p>The LDAP Require Group and LDAP Deny Group fields are for adding single
entries to narrow your search scope by a single group. The LDAP User DN
Template field will narrow down the scope to just the format you enter
in the field. In the LDAP User Search field within the configuration
page use:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCOPE_SUBTREE: to search recursively down the directory tree</li>
<li>SCOPE_ONELEVEL: to specify a search one level down the tree only</li>
<li>SCOPE_BASE: to only search the level specified in the base DN</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the results returned from the LDAP search tool to choose the values
to search by, for example: uid or sAMAccountName &amp; group or
groupOfNames. It's worth keeping in mind that LDAP User DN Template will
supercede your LDAP User Search, so only use one or the other when
setting it up.</p>

<p><strong>For Windows/AD Admins</strong></p>
<p>These steps set up a single-sign-on to Ansible Tower for logging in LDAP
users. Configuration of Ansible Tower to authenticate against
LDAP-connected hosts would be done in the Credentials section, and the
same considerations will apply to authentication against Windows hosts
that apply to Ansible.Considerations include prepping WinRM on the hosts
to <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_windows.html#windows-system-prep">accept
connections</a>.
Before preparing and running jobs against Windows hosts in an Active
Directory, make sure to have the Credentials set up appropriately!</p>
<h2>USER ATTRIBUTE MAP</h2>
<p>Finally, it's important to dedicate some time when testing LDAP
authentication to attribute user and organization mapping. The LDAP User
Attribute Map is where the LDAP attributes are mapped to Ansible Tower
attributes. Examples include first name, last name, email, etc. In this
case the email attribute is mapping to the
[userPrincipalName] in the Active Directory Server being
used. The default is "mail" for most LDAP layouts, but you will need to
know your structure in order to map accordingly.</p>
<p><img alt="Ansible-Getting-Started-Tower-LDAP-5" src="/images/posts/archive/Ansible-Getting-Started-Tower-LDAP-5.png"></p>
<p>The LDAP User Flags By Group field can be used to quickly narrow down
mapping. For example, users belonging to the OU named "secret" are
mapped to the superusers group in Ansible Tower in the example below:</p>
<p><img alt="Ansible-Getting-Started-Tower-LDAP-3" src="/images/posts/archive/Ansible-Getting-Started-Tower-LDAP-3.png"></p>
<p>More complex mapping will get equally more complex when mapping to teams
and organizations in Ansible Tower. The example being used has a single
organization with org admins defined as the OU named "secret" that was
matched in User Flags By Group.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">{
 &quot;Shield&quot;: {
  &quot;admins&quot;: [
   &quot;ou=secret,dc=shield,dc=team&quot;
  ],
  &quot;remove_admins&quot;: false,
  &quot;remove_users&quot;: false,
  &quot;users&quot;: true
 }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Users are assigned teams using the LDAP Team Map field. The simple LDAP
database in the example below is mapping two groups to two respective
teams within the same organization.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">{
 &quot;secret&quot;: {
  &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;Shield&quot;,
  &quot;users&quot;: &quot;OU=secret,DC=shield,DC=team&quot;,
  &quot;remove&quot;: false
 },
 &quot;avengers&quot;: {
  &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;Shield&quot;,
  &quot;users&quot;: &quot;OU=avengers,DC=shield,DC=team&quot;,
  &quot;remove&quot;: false
 }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Mapping users and groups to Ansible Tower will vary in difficulty based
on the LDAP database layout. Use the LDAP search command to refine your
group queries and match them accordingly in Ansible Tower.</p>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<ul>
<li>To authenticate LDAP users logging into Ansible Tower, use:
    LDAP server URI, bind DN &amp; password and user and group search</li>
<li>Using LDAP User DN Template overrides the User Search</li>
<li>Use LDAP Require Group and/or LDAP Deny Group to reduce the number
    of groups searched by Ansible Tower</li>
<li>LDAP User attributes in Ansible Tower are defined in LDAP User
    Attribute Map</li>
<li>Use LDAP User Flags By Group to set LDAP user flags in Ansible
    Tower</li>
<li>Groups in LDAP are mapped to organizations or teams in LDAP
    Organization Map and LDAP Team Map, respectively</li>
</ul>
