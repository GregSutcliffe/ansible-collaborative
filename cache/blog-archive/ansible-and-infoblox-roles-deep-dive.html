<h1>Ansible and Infoblox Roles Deep Dive</h1>
<p>As Sean Cavanaugh mentioned in his earlier Infoblox blog
post, the release of Ansible
2.5 introduced a lookup plugin, a dynamic inventory script, and five
modules that allow for Infoblox automation. A combination of these
modules and lookups in a role provides a powerful DNS automation
framework.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Today we are going to demonstrate how automating Infoblox Core Network
Services using Ansible can help make managing IP addresses and routing
traffic across your network easy, quick, and reliable. Your network
systems for virtualization and cloud require rapid provisioning life
cycles; Infoblox helps you manage those lifecycles. When paired with
Infoblox, Ansible lets you automate that work. Ansible's integration
with Infoblox is flexible and powerful: you can automate Infoblox tasks
with modules or with direct calls to the Infoblox WAPI REST API.</p>
<p>This post will walk you through six real-world scenarios where Ansible
and Infoblox can streamline your network tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating a provider in one place that is reusable across a collection of roles.</li>
<li>Expanding your network by creating a new subnet with a forward DNS zone. Ansible modules for Infoblox make this common two-part task
    simple.</li>
<li>Creating a reverse DNS zone, for example, to flag email from any IP
    addresses that don't have an associated address name. You must do
    this task with calls to the Infoblox API for older versions of
    Ansible, but this is now supported functionality in the
    <code>nios_zone</code> module as
    of Ansible v2.7.</li>
<li>Reserving a host record for the gateway address of your new subnet
    with Ansible's powerful Jinja2 templates.</li>
<li>Creating additional hosts in the subnet using a loop and
    <code>host_count</code>.</li>
<li>Managing Infoblox Grids to automate your network at scale, where one
    Infoblox appliance may not be enough. Grids physically separate your
    managed network and eliminate single points of failure.</li>
</ol>
<p>To follow along with these examples on your own Infoblox devices, you'll
need to install the
<a href="https://github.com/network-automation/dynamic-infoblox">dynamic-infoblox Roles</a> and set
up your Infoblox credentials as a provider.</p>
<h3>Infoblox credentials and the nios_provider</h3>
<p>[Any time you use Ansible with Infoblox, invoking an Infoblox
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/lookup.html">lookup</a> or
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_net_tools_modules.html#nios">module</a>,
you must specify the Infoblox IP, username, and the user's password.
<a href="https://github.com/network-automation/dynamic-infoblox">Our Roles</a> call
these credentials, taken together, the
<code>nios_provider</code>. By
creating a <code>nios_provider</code>
dictionary as a group variable, you can apply these values consistently
in all your playbooks and roles, referring to them in a single line
whenever you need them.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">group_vars</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">all</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">yml</span><span class="o">*</span>

</pre></div>

<h3>Using modules to set up a subnet and forward DNS zone</h3>
<p>Once you've got your credentials ready, you can run a playbook that
leverages the
<a href="https://github.com/network-automation/dynamic-infoblox/tree/master/roles/dynamicInfoblox">dynamic Infoblox</a>
Role to create a subnet and a forward DNS zone; Ansible modules take
care of this with ease. Creating a subnet is a common network project:
subnets allow an administrator to expand the network, responding to a
new company branch, office, or line of business. Forward DNS zones
establish the single direction mapping of address names to IP addresses.
A new DNS zone may be required for a business to expand its global reach
into an additional country (e.g. .uk) or respond to a merger. The tasks
shown here define <code>ansible_subnet</code> and <code>ansible_zone</code> as
variables, so you can override them each time you create a new subnet.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="x">- name: Create a test network subnet</span>
<span class="x">  nios_network:</span>
<span class="x">     network: &quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">ansible_subnet</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot;</span>
<span class="x">     comment: Test network subnet to add host records to</span>
<span class="x">     state: present</span>
<span class="x">     provider: &quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">nios_provider</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot;</span>

<span class="x">- name: &quot;Create a forward DNS zone called </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">ansible_zone</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot;</span>
<span class="x">  nios_zone:</span>
<span class="x">     name: &quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">ansible_zone</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot;</span>
<span class="x">     comment: local DNS zone</span>
<span class="x">     state: present</span>
<span class="x">     provider: &quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">nios_provider</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In this example, we've used the default Infoblox View. Infoblox allows
multiple Views within a single DNS zone. If you want to route internal
traffic to on-premise servers and route external traffic to public cloud
servers, you can do that by designing a DNS zone with two DNS Views.
This type of setup ensures that traffic to your employee intranet does
not burden the servers your customers use, providing better geographic
coverage and higher levels of around-the-clock coverage for customers.
However, for the simple example above (and subsequent examples), we've
stuck to using the default View.</p>
<h3>Using the Infoblox API to set up a reverse DNS zone</h3>
<p>So far you've seen how to use Ansible modules to automate Infoblox
changes. Our next example shows how to use the Infoblox WAPI REST API to
automate a task that may not be available in your current version of
Ansible. Reverse DNS zones allow a client to look up an address name if
they know the equivalent IP address. The importance of reverse zones can
be illustrated with a common example: email servers. Incoming traffic
from an IP address that does not have an associated address name through
reverse DNS can often be flagged as spam. Reverse zones can also help
with other use cases, like gathering authentic data about other
businesses that visit your websites.</p>
<p>The <code>nios_zone</code> module can
already create a forward DNS zone, but it can only create reverse zones
with the latest version of Ansible. However, you can still automate this
task in older versions of Ansible - just use Ansible to make calls
directly to the WAPI API. You can do this with either the uri module or
a shell script. We recommend the uri module, since it helps capture the
integration more descriptively and enables idempotent calls leveraging
standard REST return codes. Here the uri module serves as a umbrella
module to succinctly capture a single WAPI call within the Ansible
module ecosystem. It is worth noting that the WAPI API operates much
like Ansible modules: JSON in and JSON out. If you express the body of
the API call in yaml, it is easy to use a Jinja2 filter (a topic we will
revisit in depth) to convert it to JSON at runtime.</p>

</pre></div>

<p>If you establish the subnet, forward zone, and reverse zone before
creating any host records, each host record you create in that forward
zone automatically creates the corresponding reverse zone entry! With a
network, forward zone, and reverse zone defined, the stage is set to
start creating host records for your new subnet.</p>
<h3>Using a Jinja2 template to reserve the gateway address</h3>
<p>When you start creating host records, you want to reserve the first (or
last) host record in the zone as the gateway address, the address that
forwards packets of data destined for an IP address outside of the
immediate network. As mentioned earlier, you can use Jinja2 filters to
manipulate data by calling a short python function on it; the Jinja2
filter syntax effectively acts as a
<a href="http://www.linfo.org/pipes.html">linux pipe</a>. Jinja2 filters are a way to
quickly manipulate data and in this case we use two of them (see example
below) to adhere to Infoblox gateway address naming conventions. It is
important to note that defining the gateway address name relative to the
subnet avoids gateway address name overwrites because it is common for
each subnet to have its own gateway address.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Create</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">host</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">record</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">gateway</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">address</span>

</pre></div>

<p>This task builds your gateway host name step by step with this complex
Jinja2 expression. The Ansible-packaged
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_filters_ipaddr.html#converting-subnet-masks-to-cidr-notation">ipaddr filter</a>
is versatile - it is capable of achieving a larger number of routine IP
address manipulations. For example, if your IP range is 192.168.1.0/24
and your <code>ansible_zone</code> is
ansible.local, the filter in the task above creates a name in a single
line:</p>
<ol>
<li>Expression starts with "gateway"</li>
<li>The section in the does a few things:
    a. Retrieves the templated value of ansible_subnet
    <code>ansible_subnet =&gt; 198.168.1.0/24</code>
    b. Uses the retrieved ansible_subnet value and supplies it to the
    ipaddr('first_usable') filter plugin to obtain first usable IP
    <code>192.168.1.0/24 | ipaddr('first_usable') =&gt; 192.168.1.1</code>
    c. Formats the resulting IP with underscores instead of dots
    <code>192.168.1.1 | replace('.', '_') =&gt; 192_168_1_1</code>
    d. Adds a <code>.</code> separator before the subnet value
    e. Retrieves the templated value of ansible_zone
    <code>ansible_zone =&gt; ansible.local</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The gateway host name, passing the values listed above through the
example template, would be:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">gateway192_168_1_1.ansible.local
</pre></div>

<p>Jinja2 filters are a complex Ansible topic; you should have a solid
Ansible foundation before building your own Jinja2 filters. As you start
creating filters, you can test expected values locally, or leverage
<a href="https://ansible.sivel.net/test/">Sivel's Ansible Template Tester</a> to
see the results of your filters before you use them in a playbook or
role. </p>
<p><img alt="Infoblox-Roles-Deep-Dive-Ansible-Template-Tester" src="/images/posts/archive/Infoblox-Roles-Deep-Dive-Ansible-Template-Tester.png"></p>
<h3>Using loops and host_count to generate host records</h3>
<p>Once your gateway address is reserved, you can use a loop to generate a
known number of additional host records. In a real-world scenario, you
would probably generate groups of servers within the subnet (for
example, database servers, application servers, etc.). For this simple
demo, you can define a loop that will dynamically generate generic host
records based on a user-supplied <code>host_count</code> value. This
demo shows the power of <code>nios_next_ip</code> lookup
plugin, which can obtain a single next available IP or a range of next
available IPs to assign. In a Playbook with both tasks (the one above
that creates a host record for the gateway address and the one below
that generates host records), if you don't define a
<code>host_count</code>, the playbook won't create any additional host records;
just the gateway address will be created.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1">#Generating records this way should be for demo purposes</span>
<span class="c1">#Normal scenario would be to iterate over a dictionary/list of hosts or populate via a static csv file</span>

<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">loop_control</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">     </span><span class="nt">loop_var</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">count</span>

<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">when</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">host_count is defined</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you generate host records with Ansible based on a user-supplied host
count, wouldn't looping through a host count potentially cause indexing
issues on a second run? Unfortunately it does, but keeping a total count
of generated hosts solves this problem. One approach is to maintain a
static total host count file on the control node viewed as a source of
truth. By leveraging Ansible's lookup plugin feature to retrieve its
contents, each time a host is generated the count in this file is
incremented so consequent role executions (especially those automated in
different subnets) do not overwrite each other's records!</p>
<p>Generating host records this way is different than generating them with
naming conventions like most enterprises do, but it is an easy
out-of-the-box method using the <code>nios_next_ip</code> lookup to
create some records across different zones and/or subnets. Infoblox also
supports a csv record import feature for static records.</p>

<h3>Predefine Infoblox Grids with Ansible</h3>
<p>In the first four scenarios, you've seen how Ansible works with Infoblox
at the level of hosts and subnets. What can Ansible do with Infoblox at
scale? Automating a single Infoblox instance provides value, but
production Infoblox systems are often designed in a Grid. The Infoblox
website explains the full power of Infoblox Grid technology. The
Infoblox Grid establishes a distributed relationship between individual
or paired appliances to remove single points of failure and other
operational risks inherent in legacy DNS, DHCP, and IP Address
Management infrastructure. Each Grid contains one Grid Master and a
varying number of additional Grid Members and/or Grid Master candidates.
Grid Members only contain a portion of the Infoblox database needed to
do their job. Grid Master Candidates, on the other hand, have a
real-time full copy of the Grid Master's database to provide disaster
recovery functionality. You can use our Ansible Roles to predefine new
Grid Master Candidates and Grid Members like this:</p>

<p>As you can see from these five examples, Ansible and Infoblox work
together to manage your network infrastructure and the traffic it
carries quickly, easily, and reliably. Ansible builds on the robust
capabilities of the Infoblox WAPI API. Using Ansible modules and direct
calls to the WAPI API, you can write reusable Ansible Roles and
Playbooks that can be quickly adapted to handle separate networks. If
you'd like, you can start by customizing the roles in the
<a href="https://github.com/network-automation/dynamic-infoblox">ansible-networking repository</a>,
which connect all of the Ansible concepts discussed in today's post.</p>
