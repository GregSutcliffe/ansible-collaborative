<h1>Introducing the Ansible API for ServiceNow ITSM</h1>
<p>One of the most popular platform integrations available to Ansible
Automation Platform subscribers in <a href="https://console.redhat.com/">Ansible automation
hub</a> is the Red Hat Ansible Certified
Content Collection for ServiceNow ITSM. This collection helps you create
new automation workflows faster based on ServiceNow ITSM while
establishing a single source of truth in the ServiceNow configuration
management database (CMDB). You can help free teams from hours of manual
effort and have greater data integrity within your ServiceNow ITSM
instance. </p>
<p>For ServiceNow users, we've launched a new native ServiceNow
application, the API for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Certified
Content Collection, available exclusively through the <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/">ServiceNow
store</a> to enhance and support the
integration between the two platforms.   </p>
<h1>What is the Ansible API for ServiceNow ITSM?</h1>
<p>The API for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Certified Content
Collection integrates Ansible's certified content with your ServiceNow
instance. Prior to the launch of ServiceNow's Rome API, Ansible users
could download the Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Collection for
ServiceNow ITSM from the Ansible automation hub and directly manage
ServiceNow resources using their REST API. </p>
<p><strong>With the release of Rome</strong>, the REST API no longer provided all of the
support needed to automate ServiceNow using Ansible. To remedy this
problem, Red Hat and our partner, XLAB, developed this new API to
enhance and restore that functionality. </p>
<p>While the need to develop the Ansible API for ServiceNow ITSM was a
result of the release of Rome, it's also compatible with ServiceNow
ITSM San Diego and Tokyo.</p>
<h1>What can you automate in the ServiceNow ITSM?</h1>
<p>Using both the API and the Certified Content Collection for ServiceNow
ITSM, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automate change requests.</strong> Use Ansible Playbooks to automate
    ServiceNow ITSM service requests, including reporting change results
    and all information related to those changes. Your service
    representatives can simply kick off an Ansible Playbook to resolve
    common requests and reduce rote, repetitive tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Automate incident response.</strong> Assets in the ServiceNow Certified
    Collection support automatic updates to incident tickets to provide
    a consistent audit trail. Your team can also streamline the required
    steps for issue remediation and apply them at scale.</li>
<li><strong>Enable full "closed loop" automation.</strong> Simplify the opening,
    advancement, and resolution of IT service management workflow items
    while keeping relevant and accurate information flowing into the
    CMDB across disparate users, teams, and assets. Ensure that
    infrastructure information is always up to date, actionable, and
    auditable while work is completed by cross-domain teams that may or
    may not have access to ServiceNow.</li>
</ul>
