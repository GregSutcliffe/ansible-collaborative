<h1>The Song Remains The Same</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-closes-landmark-acquisition-red-hat-34-billion-defines-open-hybrid-cloud-future">Now that Red Hat is a part of IBM</a>,
some people may wonder about the future of the Ansible project.</p>
<p>Here is the good news: the Ansible community strategy has not changed.</p>
<p>As always, we want to make it as easy as possible to work with any
projects and communities who want to work with Ansible. With the
resources of IBM behind us, we plan to accelerate these efforts. We want
to do more integrations with more open source communities and more
technologies.</p>
<p>One of the reasons we are excited for the merger is that IBM understands
the importance of a broad and diverse community. Search for "Ansible
plus open source project" and you can find Ansible information, such
as playbooks and modules and blog posts and videos and slide decks,
intended to make working with that project easier. We have thousands of
people attending Ansible meetups and events all over the world. We have
millions of downloads. We have had this momentum because we provide
users flexibility and freedom. IBM is committed to our independence as a
community so that we can continue this work.</p>
<p>We've worked hard to be good open source citizens. We value the trust
that we've built with our users and our contributors, and we intend to
continue to live up to the trust that our community has placed in us.
IBM is committed to the same ideals and will be supportive of our
ongoing efforts to build a strong, diverse community. The song remains
the same.</p>
<p>If you have questions or would like to learn more about the IBM
acquisition, we encourage you to review the list of materials below. Red
Hat CTO Chris Wright will host an online Q&amp;A session July 23 in the
coming days where you can ask questions you may have about what the
acquisition means for Red Hat and our involvement in open source
communities. Details will be announced on the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog">Red Hat blog</a>.</p>
