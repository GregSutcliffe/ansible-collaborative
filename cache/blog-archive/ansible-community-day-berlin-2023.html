<h1>Ansible Community Day, Berlin 2023</h1>
<p><img alt="Ansible community day logo" src="/images/posts/archive/community-day-berliin-20230824.png"> </p>
<p>The Ansible Community Day is a new initiative by the Ansible Community
Team at Red Hat to connect with the people using, contributing to, and
developing the Ansible project worldwide. This new event complements the
Ansible Contributor Summit, to put the users of Ansible in all their
shapes and forms front and center.</p>
<p>In the last Ansible Community Day in Boston, the day right before
AnsibleFest 2023, the community had the opportunity to meet in-person
and get to know each other, learn a few things and share their knowledge
using Ansible. It was such a great experience that we couldn't wait to
have another. And here it is!</p>
<h2>Guten Tag Berlin!</h2>
<p>After two very successful Ansible Community Day events this year, the
first in Pune, India in February and the next in Boston in May, our
third event for 2023 will be held in Berlin, Germany!</p>
<p>Registration for Ansible Community Day Berlin 2023 is now open! If you'd
like to attend, please check out the following
<a href="https://ansible-community-day-berlin-2023.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite page for specific details and registration.</a> </p>
<p>The event is set for Wednesday, September 20, 2023.
We will meet in c-base (Rungestraße 20, Berlin, Germany)</p>

<h2>Call for Proposals (CFP)</h2>
<p>We are looking for speakers!</p>
