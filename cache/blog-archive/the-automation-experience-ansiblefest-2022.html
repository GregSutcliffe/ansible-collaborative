<h2>Spotlight Sessions</h2>
<p>In Chicago, we're introducing a new session segment, Spotlight Stage.
These sessions will be 15 minute lightning talks and demos from key
Ansible customers and partners, with an interactive component where the
speakers will answer questions from the audience. The Spotlight Stage
will be attached directly to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
booth in the expo hall for easy access for all
attendees.</p>
<h2>Communities of Practice</h2>
<p>The Communities of Practice are a new set of open forums in the
AnsibleFest Hallway Track for this year's AnsibleFest. These are 30
minute open forums led by Ansible experts in a set of diverse topics.
The audience will drive the discussion on
these topics based on what they want to learn from the experts. We will
be covering topics that include automation community + enthusiasm,
network automation, Ansible Automation Platform, automation at the edge,
security automation, event-driven automation, and cloud
automation.Â </p>
<h2>Ask the Expert</h2>
<p>As AnsibleFest returns in-person, we're excited to bring back the Ask
the Expert area. Here, you can get one-on-one time with Ansible experts
to ask any burning questions about automation. We will now feature a
larger space with designated areas for each expert's individual
expertise, helping ensure you can find the right person for your
questions. Experts will cover a wide range of topics that include
product components and features, migrations, as well as use
case-specific topics, like edge, network and event-driven
automation.</p>
