<h1>Introduction to ansible-test</h1>
<p>As automation becomes crucial for more and more business cases, there is
an increased need to test the automation code itself. This is where
ansible-test comes in: developers who want to test their Ansible Content
Collections for sanity, unit and integration tests can use 
ansible-test  to achieve testing workflows that integrate with source
code repositories.</p>
<p>Both ansible-core and ansible-base come
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html">packaged</a>
with a cli tool called ansible-test, which can be used by collection
developers to test their Collection and its content. The ansible-test
knows how to perform a wide variety of testing-related tasks, from
linting module documentation and code to running unit and integration
tests.</p>
<p>We will cover different features of ansible-test in brief below.</p>
<h1>How to run ansible-test?</h1>
<p>With the general availability of Ansible Content Collections with Ansible-2.9,
a user can run ansible-test inside a collection to test the collection
itself. ansible-test needs to be run from the collection root or below
in order for ansible-test to run tests on the Collection.</p>
<p>If you try to run ansible-test from outside the above directory norms,
it will throw an error like below:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">root@root<span class="w"> </span>~/.ansible/collections<span class="w"> </span>ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>sanity
ERROR:<span class="w"> </span>The<span class="w"> </span>current<span class="w"> </span>working<span class="w"> </span>directory<span class="w"> </span>must<span class="w"> </span>be<span class="w"> </span>at<span class="w"> </span>or<span class="w"> </span>below:

-<span class="w"> </span>an<span class="w"> </span>Ansible<span class="w"> </span>collection:<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">{</span>...<span class="o">}</span>/ansible_collections/<span class="o">{</span>namespace<span class="o">}</span>/<span class="o">{</span>collection<span class="o">}</span>/

Current<span class="w"> </span>working<span class="w"> </span>directory:<span class="w"> </span>/root/.ansible/collections
</pre></div>

<p>from the above output you can see how a collection root appears to
ansible-test, it has to be in the form of:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">{</span>...<span class="o">}</span>/ansible_collections/<span class="o">{</span>namespace<span class="o">}</span>/<span class="o">{</span>collection<span class="o">}</span>/
</pre></div>

<p>When you install a collection from Ansible Galaxy or Automation Hub, the default installation location is:
<code>{...}/ansible_collections/{namespace}/{collection}/</code>, which already satisfies the above directory convention.</p>
<p>Even if you specify the installation path to the ansible-galaxy cli
(using the -p option), it will also install a collection inside the
ansible_collections directory by creating one in the given path, like
below:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">root@root<span class="w"> </span>~/temp<span class="w"> </span>ll
total<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">0</span>

root@root<span class="w"> </span>~/temp<span class="w"> </span>ansible-galaxy<span class="w"> </span>collection<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>arista.eos<span class="w"> </span>-p<span class="w"> </span>.

root@root<span class="w"> </span>~/temp<span class="w"> </span>ll
total<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">4</span>.0K
drwxrwxr-x.<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">4</span><span class="w"> </span>root<span class="w"> </span>root<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">4</span>.0K<span class="w"> </span>Jan<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">18</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">19</span>:21<span class="w"> </span>ansible_collections
</pre></div>

<p>Make sure you keep the above directory norm when you develop your
collections and test them with ansible-test too, in your local
development environment.</p>
<h2>How to test your collection using ansible-test?</h2>
<p>ansible-test provides ways to run different types of tests on your
Collections, broadly these tests are of types listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sanity Tests</li>
<li>Unit Tests</li>
<li>Integration Tests</li>
</ul>
<p>We will go through each of these tests in detail.</p>
<h2>Sanity Tests</h2>
<p>Sanity tests are made up of scripts and tools used to perform static
code analysis. The primary purpose of these tests is to enforce Ansible
coding standards and requirements. ansible-test includes a variety of
sanity tests to perform the code analysis, which can be found
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/testing/sanity/index.html#all-sanity-tests">in the documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>How to run?</h2>
<p>You can run the sanity test suite from the root directory of your
collection; below are different scenarios on how you can run the sanity
tests.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1"># Run all sanity tests</span>
ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>sanity

<span class="c1"># Run all sanity tests against against certain files</span>
ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>sanity<span class="w"> </span>plugins/modules/files/eos_acls.py

<span class="c1"># Run all tests with a specific version of python (3.7 in this case)</span>
ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>sanity<span class="w"> </span>--python<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span>.7

<span class="c1"># Run all tests inside docker (good if you don&#39;t have dependencies installed)</span>
ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>sanity<span class="w"> </span>--docker<span class="w"> </span>default

<span class="c1"># Run validate-modules against a specific file</span>
ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>sanity<span class="w"> </span>--test<span class="w"> </span>validate-modules<span class="w"> </span>lib/ansible/modules/files/template.py
</pre></div>

<p>To list all the sanity tests available:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>sanity<span class="w"> </span>--list-tests
</pre></div>

<h3>How to ignore sanity tests?</h3>
<p>Since sanity tests change between Ansible releases, a separate ignore
file is needed for each Ansible major release.</p>
<p>The filename is <code>tests/sanity/ignore-X.Y.txt</code>
where <code>X.Y</code> is the <code>ansible-core/ansible-base</code> release being used to test the collection.</p>
<p>Maintaining a separate file for each Ansible release allows a collection to pass tests for multiple versions of Ansible.</p>
<p>For information on the format of the ignore files, please refer to the
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/testing/sanity/ignores.html#ignore-file-format">dev guide</a></p>
<p>There are only a limited number of cases where ignores would be needed, so please refer to the
<a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/collection_requirements.rst#ci-testing">collections documentation</a></p>
<h2>Unit Tests</h2>
<p>Unit tests are small isolated tests that target a specific library or
module. As a collection developer/maintainer, you want to make sure that
your code is unit tested, and ansible-test provides a way to run and do
reporting of unit tests inside your collection.</p>
<ol>
<li>The tests/units is where all things related to unit testing live</li>
<li>ansible-test uses PyTest underneath the surface to do unit testing, hence it expects the tests to be located in files starting with <code>test_</code> or ending with <code>_test.py</code></li>
</ol>
<p>For more information on how to write unit tests, please refer to the
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/testing_units_modules.html">guide</a>.</p>
<p>To run all the unit tests inside a collection, run the below command
from collection root:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1"># Run all tests inside docker (good if you don&#39;t have dependencies installed)</span>
ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>units<span class="w"> </span>--docker<span class="w"> </span>-v
</pre></div>

<p>Against a single module file by doing:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1"># Only runs if the module directory path and unit test file path are similar</span>
ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>units<span class="w"> </span>--docker<span class="w"> </span>-v<span class="w"> </span>apt
</pre></div>

<p>Or against a specific python version by doing:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>units<span class="w"> </span>--docker<span class="w"> </span>-v<span class="w"> </span>--python<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span>.7<span class="w"> </span>apt
</pre></div>

<p>If you are running unit tests against things other than modules, such as
module utilities, specify the whole file path:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>units<span class="w"> </span>--docker<span class="w"> </span>-v<span class="w"> </span>test/units/module_utils/basic/test_imports.py
</pre></div>

<p>For advanced usage, see the help:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>units<span class="w"> </span>--help
</pre></div>

<h2>Code Coverage</h2>
<p>Code coverage reports make it easy to identify untested code for which
more tests should be written.</p>
<p>Add the <code>--coverage</code>= option to any test
command to collect code coverage data. If you aren't using the
<code>--venv</code> or <code>--docker</code> options that create an isolated
python environment, then you may have to use the <code>--requirements</code>
option to ensure that the correct version of
the coverage module is installed:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>coverage<span class="w"> </span>erase
ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>units<span class="w"> </span>--coverage<span class="w"> </span>apt
ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>coverage<span class="w"> </span>html
</pre></div>

<p>Reports can be generated in several different formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ansible-test coverage report</code> - Console report.</li>
<li>[<code>ansible-test coverage html</code> - HTML report.</li>
<li>[<code>ansible-test coverage xml</code> - XML report.</li>
</ul>
<p>To clear data between test runs, use the ansible-test coverage erase
command. For a full list of features, see the online help:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ansible-test<span class="w"> </span>coverage<span class="w"> </span>--help
</pre></div>

<h2>Integration Tests</h2>
<p>These are end to end tests to check code path functions as expected and
to catch breaking changes in the product that you are trying to
automate. In the context of ansible-test essentially:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>tests/integration</code> is where all things related to integration tests live.</li>
<li>The <code>tests/integration/targets</code> directory contains all our test cases.
    Each test case is a barebones Ansible Role.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Conclusion &amp; Next Steps</h1>
<p>As shown above, ansible-test can provide a lot of value testing Ansible
Content Collections thoroughly.</p>
