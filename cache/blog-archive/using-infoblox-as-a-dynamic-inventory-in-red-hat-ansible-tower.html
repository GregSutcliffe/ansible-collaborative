<h1>Using Infoblox as a dynamic inventory in Red Hat Ansible Tower</h1>
<p>Do you still use spreadsheets to keep track of all your device
inventory? Do you have Infoblox Appliances deployed in your
infrastructure? Do you want to start automating without the burden of
maintaining a static register of devices? If you answered yes to any of
these questions, this blog is for you.</p>
<p>Operations teams often struggle to keep their <em>Configuration Management
Databases</em> (CMDBs) up-to-date, primarily because they were not involved
in the specification process to share what pieces of information are
relevant to them, or even if they were, once it is put in place:</p>
<p>Teams are not allowed to change any of their <strong>Configuration Items (CI) because they have only read-only access!</strong></p>
<p>The reality is that a lot of the time when we talk about a <em>CMDB</em>, we
are talking about tables in a database without any version control
mechanism, therefore only read access is provided to end users.</p>
<p>The impact is that in order to perform lifecycle management
(Create/Update/Decommission) of their configuration items, teams must go
through a fastidious and manual process until they give up changing CIs
(Configuration Items) in the CMDB and just leave everything as it is.
<strong>What happens next?</strong> Different teams start to rely on their own
<em>CMDBs</em> (A.K.A spreadsheets), to track subnets, IP allocations, DNS
records, Zones, Views, etc. <strong>What's the end result?</strong> End users
request their machines and still need to wait at least a week before
someone from the NetOps team consults their own CMDB (yes, the
spreadsheet) to provide them DNS records and IP addresses.</p>
<h2>Dynamic Inventory</h2>
<p>Dynamic Inventory is one of the most powerful features in Red Hat
Ansible Tower. Dynamic Inventory allows Ansible to query external
systems and use the response data to construct its inventory. Red Hat
Ansible Tower provides some out-of-the-box integrations through dynamic
inventory scripts, and also allows users to extend these capabilities by
providing their own <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/administration/custom_inventory_script.html">custom dynamic inventory script</a>.</p>
<h3>Red Hat Ansible Tower and Infoblox</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at the steps required to configure a custom dynamic
inventory script to query Infoblox and rely on it as our inventory
source of truth.</p>
<h4>Install infoblox-client</h4>
<p>First we need to install the infoblox-client python library in Red Hat
Ansible Tower's venv of each node of the cluster, and the configuration
file required by the infoblox inventory script:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1"># source /var/lib/awx/venv/awx/bin/activate</span>
<span class="c1"># pip install infoblox-client</span>
</pre></div>

<p>NOTE: You could also create a <a href="https://gist.github.com/victorock/493b2d41f5a148efbed9e66dc2e8dee1">playbook to do</a>
this, using the Ansible <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/pip_module.html">pip_module</a>.</p>
<p>Create the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/infoblox.yaml">infoblox configuration file</a>
in <a href="https://gist.github.com/victorock/3c28056b41e3489d731cc5a2801f2166">/etc/ansible/infoblox.yaml</a>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="nt">filters</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">extattrs</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p p-Indicator">{}</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">view</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">null</span>
</pre></div>

<p><em>NOTE: Follow</em> <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/53526"><em>this Ansible GitHub
Issue</em></a> <em>where I
suggest taking configuration items from an environment variable or a
file for added flexibility.</em></p>
<h4>Credential Type</h4>
<p>After the installation in the previous step completes successfully in
all the nodes of the cluster, we need to specify in Ansible Tower the
credential and hostname to establish communication with Infoblox
Appliances. As of today we don't have any specific Ansible Tower
Credential for Infoblox, so let's create a <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credential_types.html">custom credential
type</a>.
We can then provide the information required to communicate with
Infoblox, have the password protected by Ansible Tower and
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/security.html#role-based-access-controls">RBAC</a>
(Role-Based Access Control).</p>
<p>As Administrator, go to <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credential_types.html">Credential
Types</a>
in the left menu.</p>
<p>Create a new credential type: <em>INFOBLOX_INVENTORY</em> (Green + sign)</p>
<p><img alt="Credential Types - Infoblox Inventory" src="/images/posts/archive/image12.png"></p>
<p><img alt="screenshot" src="/images/posts/archive/image5-2.png"></p>
<p>Define the inputs required in the <em>INPUT CONFIGURATION</em> field:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">fields</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">type</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">string</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">id</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">hostname</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">label</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Hostname</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">type</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">string</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">id</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">username</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">label</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Username</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">secret</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">true</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">type</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">string</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">id</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">password</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">label</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Password</span>
<span class="nt">required</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">username</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">password</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Define the injection of inputs as environment variables in <em>INJECTOR CONFIGURATION</em> field:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">env:
<span class="w">  </span>INFOBLOX_HOST:<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;{{ hostname }}&#39;</span>
<span class="w">  </span>INFOBLOX_PASSWORD:<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;{{ password }}&#39;</span>
<span class="w">  </span>INFOBLOX_USERNAME:<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;{{ username }}&#39;</span>
</pre></div>

<h4>Credential</h4>
<p>After the creation of the credential type INFOBLOX_INVENTORY in Ansible
Tower, we can use it to create a new credential, specifying the
information to communicate with the Infoblox Appliance.</p>
<p>Create a credential to communicate with Infoblox Appliance:
<code>infoblox-ip.ip.ip.ip</code></p>
<p><img alt="Create credential" src="/images/posts/archive/image2-4.png"></p>
<p><em>NOTE: In the example, the name includes theÂ IP or FQDN, so we can know
what appliance this particular credential refers to.</em></p>
<h4>Inventory Script</h4>
<p>Creation of custom inventory script to query Infoblox Appliances and
parse the output to the format expected by Ansible inventory.</p>
<p>Create a new <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/administration/custom_inventory_script.html">custom inventory script</a>: <code>_infoblox-inventory-script.py</code></p>
<p>Get the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/infoblox.py">infoblox.py</a>
from Ansible's GitHub and paste into the <em>CUSTOM SCRIPT</em> field:</p>
<p><img alt="Create inventory script" src="/images/posts/archive/image14.png"></p>
<h4>Inventory Source</h4>
<p>Creation of inventory with the infoblox dynamic script as dynamic source
and sync to populate our inventory with entries returned by Infoblox
Appliance.</p>
<p>Go to Inventories and <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/quickstart/create_inventory.html">create a new Inventory</a>: <code>netops</code></p>
<p><img alt="Create inventory" src="/images/posts/archive/image8.png"></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/inventories.html#add-source">Add Source</a> referring to the infoblox-dynamic-script.py:</p>
<p><img alt="add source" src="/images/posts/archive/image2-5.png"></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/inventories.html#add-source">Sync the Inventory Source</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="sync inventory source" src="/images/posts/archive/image10.png"></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/inventories.html#view-completed-jobs">Check Sync Status</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="check sync status" src="/images/posts/archive/image1-5.png"></p>
<h4>Inventory Entries</h4>
<p>Verification if the hosts, groups and variables are being populated
correctly in the inventory, based on existing entries in Infoblox
Appliance:</p>
<p>Check host entries in inventory: Â <code>netops</code> -&gt; <code>hosts</code></p>
<p><img alt="check host inventory " src="/images/posts/archive/image11.png"></p>
<p>Check variables associate to a host entry: <code>netops</code> -&gt; <code>hosts</code> -&gt; <code>rtr01.acme.com</code></p>
<p><img alt="check variables" src="/images/posts/archive/image4-2.png"></p>
<p><img alt="host details " src="/images/posts/archive/image13.png"></p>
<p><img alt="check inventories" src="/images/posts/archive/image6-1.png"></p>
<p>At this point we have servers and routers in our dynamic inventory,
therefore from now on we can execute any Ansible Playbooks against them.
Â In the next section we'll cover how the configurations looks like in
the infoblox side.</p>
<h4>Infoblox</h4>
<p>At this point you may be wondering: How are these variables in Ansible
Tower's Inventory specified in my Infoblox Appliance? The answer is
that we are using <em>Extensible Attributes</em> in Infoblox to fulfill
ansible_* variables, so they are automatically populated in Ansible
Tower's inventory. Follow below some screenshots taken from Infoblox's
WEBUI:</p>
<p>Extensible Attributes Configuration in Infoblox, for the variable "ansible_host":</p>
<p><img alt="Extensible Attributes Configuration in Infoblox" src="/images/posts/archive/image9.png"></p>
<h4>Why are we using Extensible Attributes?</h4>
<p>The answer is simple. It is common to have entries in the DNS that
refers to the production interface of the server or the service being
provided, meanwhile the management access is only available via a
dedicated out-of-band management interface. The <em>ansible_host</em> extra
attribute defines that for this particular entry, Ansible shall use its
value to establish communication with the server, via the management
interface.</p>
<p>Additionally, we could rely on Extensible Attributes variable to specify
if an entry is managed by Ansible Tower or not (<em>Ex: ansible_managed:
true/false</em>), and update our "<em>Dynamic Inventory Configuration File</em>"
accordingly, to use this particular attribute as a filter. The result is
that Ansible Tower's inventory will only populate with entries that we
want to automate (<em>ansible_managed: true</em>).</p>
