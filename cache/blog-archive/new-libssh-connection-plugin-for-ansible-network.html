<h1>New LibSSH Connection Plugin for Ansible Network Replaces Paramiko, Adds FIPS Mode Enablement</h1>
<p>As Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform expands its footprint with a
growing customer base, security continues to be an important aspect of
organizations' overall strategy. Red Hat regularly reviews and enhances
the foundational codebase to follow better security practices. As part
of this effort, we are introducing <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/security/definitions/what-does-mean-fips-compliant/">FIPS 140-2
readiness</a>
enablement by means of a newly developed Ansible SSH connection plugin
that uses the <a href="https://www.libssh.org/">libssh</a> library.</p>
<h2>Ansible Network SSH Connection Basics</h2>
<p>Since most network appliances don't support or have limited capability
for the local execution of a third party software, the Ansible network
modules are not copied to the remote host unlike linux hosts; instead,
they run on the control node itself. Hence, Ansible network can't use
the typical Ansible SSH connection plugin that is used with linux host.
Furthermore, due to this behavior, performance of the underlying SSH
subsystem is critical. Not only is the new LibSSH connection plugin
enabling FIPS readiness, but it was also designed to be
<a href="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/posts/comparing-ssh/">more performant than the existing Paramiko SSH subsystem</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="diagram of module code execution" src="/images/posts/archive/module-code-execution-diagram.png"></p>
<p>The top level <code>network_cli</code> connection
plugin, provided by the ansible.netcommon Collection (specifically
<code>ansible.netcommon.network_cli</code>), provides an SSH based connection to the
network appliance. It in turn calls the <code>ansible.builtin.paramiko_ssh</code>
connection plugin that depends on the paramiko python library to
initialize the session between control node and the remote host. After
that, it creates a pseudo terminal (PTY) to send commands from the
control node to the network appliance and receive the responses.</p>
<h2>Why Replace Paramiko?</h2>
<p>The primary reason to replace the paramiko library is that it doesn't
guarantee FIPS readiness and thus limits the Ansible network capability
to run in environments that mandate FIPS mode to be enabled. Paramiko
also isn't the speediest of connection plugins, so that can also be
enhanced. Therefore, the new <code>ansible.netcommon.libssh</code> connection plugin
can now be easily swapped in for paramiko. The <code>ansible.netcommon</code>
Collection now contains this by default, and can be used for testing
purposes until the codebase becomes more stable (it is currently
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/21101">Technology Preview</a>).</p>
<p>Comparing the connection flow to the above, the top level
<code>network_cli</code> connection plugin that is provided by the <code>ansible.netcommon</code> Collection
(specifically <code>ansible.netcommon.network_cli</code>) still provides an SSH based
connection to the network appliance. It in turn calls the
<code>ansible.netcommon.libssh</code> connection plugin that depends on the
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/ansible-pylibssh/"><code>ansible-pylibssh</code> python library</a>
to initialize the session between control node and the remote host. This
python library is essentially a cython wrapper on top of the
<a href="https://www.libssh.org/">libssh C library</a>. It then creates pseudo terminals
(PTY) over SSH using python.</p>
<h2>Switching Ansible Playbooks to use LibSSH</h2>
<p>With the <code>ansible.netcommon</code> Collection version 1.0.0, a new configuration
parameter within <code>ansible.netcommon.network_cli</code> connection plugin was
added, which allows for <code>ssh_type</code> be set to either <code>libssh</code> or <code>paramiko</code>. </p>
<p>If the value of the configuration parameter is set to <code>libssh</code>, it will use the
<code>ansible.netcommon.libssh</code> connection plugin, which in turn uses the
<code>ansible-pylibssh</code> python library that supports FIPS readiness. If the
value is set to <code>paramiko</code>, it will continue to use the default
<code>ansible.builtin.paramiko</code> connection plugin that relies on the
<code>paramiko</code> python library. </p>
<p>Again, the default value is set to <code>paramiko</code>, but in the future plans are
to change the default to <code>libssh</code>.</p>
<h2>Installing and Configuring LibSSH</h2>
<p>In order to utilize the LibSSH plugin, you must first install the
<code>ansible-pylibssh</code> python library from PyPI via the following command:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">pip<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>ansible-pylibssh
</pre></div>

<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current PyPI installation method bundles the correct version of
    <code>LibSSH</code> library and its dependencies as <a href="https://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-Built-Distribution">platform-specific
    wheels</a>
    that don't rely on any OS-level libraries in runtime.</li>
<li>Future plans include creation, publishing, and maintenance of
    stand-alone RPM and DEB packages for the <code>ansible-pylibssh</code> library
    that can be installed with well-known Linux package managers. These
    will install the required system <code>libssh</code> version and its dependencies
    on the control node. FYI, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.1 and later
    contains the proper <code>libssh</code> package version and its dependencies.</li>
<li>The current primary use case for using LibSSH with Ansible is for
    connecting to network devices. Connecting to other types of
    endpoints (such as Linux) will be officially enabled at a later
    date.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using LibSSH in Ansible Playbooks</h2>
<p>Method 1:  The <code>ssh_type</code> configuration parameter can be set to use
<code>libssh</code> in the active <code>ansible.cfg</code> file of your project as shown below:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">[persistent_connection]</span>
<span class="na">ssh_type</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">libssh</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Method 2:  Set the <code>ANSIBLE_NETWORK_CLI_SSH_TYPE</code> environment variable as shown below:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">$export</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">ANSIBLE_NETWORK_CLI_SSH_TYPE</span><span class="o">=</span>libssh
</pre></div>

<p>Method 3:  Set the <code>ansible_network_cli_ssh_type</code> parameter to <code>libssh</code>
within your playbook at the play level (as shown in below example).</p>
<p>NOTE: This setting can be made at the individual task level, but only if
the connection to the remote network device is not already established.
That is, if the first task uses <code>paramiko</code>, then all subsequent tasks in
the play must use <code>paramiko</code> even if <code>libssh</code> is specified in any subsequent
tasks.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting LibSSH Connections</h2>
<p>To quickly verify the libssh transport is set correctly, you can run the
below playbook using the <code>ansible-playbook</code> command line with verbose flag
(-vvvv) added. Before running, ensure the inventory file is set correctly.</p>
<p>This example playbook uses the <code>cisco.ios</code> Collection and must first be
installed from Ansible Galaxy or Ansible Automation Platform on your
Ansible control node.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">hosts</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;changeme&quot;</span>

<p>In the output verbose logs, you should see the line <em>"ssh type is set to libssh"</em> displayed on the console, which confirms the configuration is
set correctly.</p>
