<h1>Introduction to Ansible Builder</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to another introductory Ansible blog post, where
we'll be covering a new command-line interface (CLI) tool, Ansible
Builder. Please note that this article will cover some
intermediate-level topics such as containers (Ansible Builder uses
<a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/podman-next-generation-linux-container-tools">Podman</a>
by default), virtual environments, and Ansible Content Collections.
If you have some familiarity with those topics, then read on to find out
what Ansible Builder is, why it was developed, and how to use it. </p>
<p>This project is currently in development upstream on
<a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible-builder">GitHub</a> and is not yet part
of the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform product.  As with all Red Hat
software, our <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/our-code-is-open">code is open</a>
and we have an open source development model for our enterprise
software.  The goal of this blog post is to show the current status of
this initiative, and start getting the community and customers
comfortable with our methodologies, thought process, and concept of
Execution Environments.  Feedback on this upstream project can be
provided on GitHub via comments and issues, or provided via the various
methods listed on our website.</p>
<h1>What is Ansible Builder?</h1>
<p>In a nutshell, Ansible Builder is a tool that aids in the creation of
Ansible Execution Environments. To fully understand this, let's step
back and discuss what exactly execution environments are.  </p>
<h2>A Primer on Execution Environments</h2>
<p>Before the concept of Execution Environments came about, the Ansible
Automation Platform execution system was limited to executing jobs under
<a href="https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap">bubblewrap</a> in order to
isolate processes. There were several problems related to this,
including the fact that in the cases of Red Hat OpenShift and
Kubernetes-based deployments, any container running jobs had to run in
privileged mode. In addition to this issue, consuming Ansible Content
Collections was very labor-intensive and users faced a lot of challenges
managing custom Python virtual environments and Ansible module
dependencies. The concept of Execution Environments is the solution to
these problems; simply put, they are container images that can be
utilized as Ansible control nodes. These container images enable the
simplification and automation of outdated processes.</p>
<p>As an example of how useful Execution Environments can be, let's say a
developer writes content for Ansible locally by using container
technology so that they can create portable automation runtimes; these
container images will allow that developer to share pre-packaged
Execution Environment, which can be tested and promoted to production.
This eliminates a lot of manual steps (e.g. creating a Dockerfile from
scratch) and accelerates operations by streamlining development and
deployment.  </p>
<h2>Ansible Builder is a Tool for Building Execution Environments</h2>
<p>To enable developers, contributors, and users to take advantage of this
new concept, Ansible Builder was developed to automate the process of
building Execution Environments.  It does this by using the dependency
information defined in various Ansible Content Collections, as well as
by the user. Ansible Builder will produce a directory that acts as the
build context for the container image build, which will contain the
<code>Containerfile</code>, along with any other files that need to be added to the image.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Installing</h3>
<p>You can install Ansible Builder from the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ansible-builder/">Python Package Index
(PyPI)</a> or from the main
ansible-builder development branch of the codebase hosted on
<a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible-builder">GitHub</a>. In your terminal,
simply run:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$<span class="w"> </span>pip<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>ansible-builder
</pre></div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Podman is used by default to build images. To use Docker, use
<code>ansible-builder build --container-runtime docker</code>.</p>
<h3>Writing a Definition</h3>
<p>In the world of Ansible Builder, the "definition" is a YAML file that
outlines the Execution Environment's Collection-level dependencies, base
image source, and overrides for specific items within the Execution
Environment. The <code>ansible-builder build</code> command, which we
will discuss in further detail later, takes the definition file as an
input and then outputs the build context necessary for creating an
Execution Environment image, which it then uses to actually build that
image. That same build context can consistently rebuild the Execution
Environment image elsewhere, which enables users to create distributable
working environments for any Collections. </p>
<p>Below is an example of the content that would be in a definition file:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="nt">version</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">1</span>
<span class="nt">dependencies</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">galaxy</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">requirements.yml</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">python</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">requirements.txt</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">system</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">bindep.txt</span>

<span class="nt">additional_build_steps</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">prepend</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p p-Indicator">|</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="no">RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">append</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">RUN ls -la /etc</span>
</pre></div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The build command will default to using a definition file
named <code>execution-environment.yml</code>.
If you want to use a different file, you will need to specify the file
name with the <code>-f</code> (or <code>--file</code>) flag. This file <em>must</em> be a <code>.yml</code>
formatted file.</p>
<p>In the <code>dependencies</code> section of
the definition file above, the entries that would be listed there may be
a relative path from the directory of the Execution Environment
definition's folder, or an absolute path. Below is an example of what
might be contained in a <code>requirements.yml</code> file,
which points to a valid requirements file for the
<code>ansible-galaxy collection install -r</code>... command:</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The following collection example is sourced from Automation
Hub on <a href="http://cloud.redhat.com/">cloud.redhat.com</a> and requires a valid
<a href="http://red.ht/try_ansible">Ansible Automation Platform subscription</a>
and an upcoming feature to ansible-builder to access.</p>
<ul>
<li>For more information on using Automation Hub, refer to the <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/galaxy/user_guide.html#downloading-a-collection-from-automation-hub">user
    guide</a></li>
<li>For instructions on how to use an ansible.cfg file with Ansible
    Builder, see the <a href="https://ansible-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/definition.html#ansible-config-file-path">documentation
    here</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="nt">collections</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">redhat.openshift</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>python</code> entry points to a Python requirements file for <code>pip install -r</code>.
For example, the <code>requirements.txt</code> file might contain the following:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">awxkit&gt;=13.0.0
boto&gt;=2.49.0
botocore&gt;=1.12.249
boto3&gt;=1.9.249
openshift&gt;=0.6.2
requests-oauthlib
</pre></div>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/infra/bindep/readme.html">bindep</a>
requirements file specifies cross-platform requirements, if there are
any.  These get processed by bindep and then passed to dnf (other
platforms are not yet supported as of the publication of this blog
post). An example of the content of a
<code>bindep.txt</code> file is below:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">subversion [platform:rpm]
subversion [platform:dpkg]
</pre></div>

<p>Additional commands may be specified in the <code>additional_build_steps</code> section, to be executed before the main build steps (<code>prepend</code>) or after (<code>append</code>).
The syntax needs to be either a multi-line string (as shown in the <code>prepend</code> section of the example definition file) or a list (as shown via the example's <code>append</code> section).</p>
<h3>Customizable Options</h3>
<p>Before we run the <code>build</code> command, let's discuss the customizable options you can use alongside
it.  </p>
<p><code>'-f', '--file'</code></p>
<p>This flag points to the specific definition file of the Execution Environment; it will default to <code>execution-environment.yml</code> if a different file name is not specified.</p>
<p><code>'-b', '--base-image'</code></p>
<p>The parent image for the Execution Environment; when not mentioned, it defaults to <code>quay.io/ansible/ansible-runner:devel</code>.</p>
<p><code>'-c', '--context'</code></p>
<p>The directory to use for the build context, if it should be generated in a specific place. The default location is <code>$PWD/context.</code></p>
<p><code>'--container-runtime'</code></p>
<p>Specifies which container runtime to use; the choices are <code>podman</code> (default option) or <code>docker</code>.</p>
<p><code>'--tag'</code></p>
<p>The name for the container image being built; when nothing is specified with this flag, the image will be named <code>ansible-execution-env</code>.</p>
<p>As with most CLIs, adding <code>--help</code> at the end of
any Ansible Builder command will provide output in the form of help text
that will display and explain the options available under any particular
command. Below is an example of a command for looking up help text,
along with its corresponding output:</p>

<h3>Start the Build</h3>
<p>Let's see what happens when we run the build command!
The build definition will be gathered from the default <code>execution-environment.yml</code> file as shown below:</p>

<h2>Validating with Ansible Runner</h2>
<p>Due to this new tool still being in development, we are taking a
shortcut with our current available set of tools to help us validate
against this. That being said, as of now, <code>ansible-runner</code> is a
command-line utility that has the ability to interact with playbooks. 
Also, since it is a key part of Execution Environments, our validation
for now will be that the content runs as expected.  This will change in
the future; we'll definitely come up with something bigger and better!
So stay tuned. </p>
<p>Now without further ado, let's dive into this...</p>
<p>If you do not have Ansible Runner already installed, you can refer to
its
<a href="https://ansible-runner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html">documentation</a>
for guidance. Below is an example playbook (we'll call it
<code>test.yml</code>) that can be
run via Ansible Runner to ensure that the Execution Environment is

<p>Running the command <code>ansible-runner</code> playbook will indicate to Ansible Runner that we want it to execute a playbook
that's similar to running the command <code>ansible-playbook</code> itself.
However, Ansible Runner has additional advantages over a traditional
<code>ansible-playbook</code> command, one of which is to let us take advantage of the Execution
Environment image and its dependencies, which ultimately allows the
playbook to run. For this specific example, note that we also inherited
the <code>kubeconfig</code> set per the <code>redhat.openshift.k8s</code> module; this <code>kubeconfig</code>
is automatically detected and mounted into the Execution Environment
container runtime (just as many other cloud provider modules and SSH
credentials are) without any additional input needed from the user.</p>
<h2>Distributing</h2>
<p>Execution Environment build contexts (as well as the containers built
from them) can be easily shared via public or private registries.  This
new workflow process allows users to automate tasks that were once more
manual (e.g. container images can be scanned and rebuilt automatically
when vulnerabilities are discovered inside).  The build context,
generated when we ran the <code>ansible-builder</code> command,
can be committed to source control and utilized later without the need
for Ansible Builder, either locally or on another system.</p>
<h3>Push to GitHub</h3>
<p>After an Execution Environment image has been built using Ansible
Builder, all of the build context files can be pushed to GitHub (or any
other version control system) for distribution.  See below for an
example of a repository that hosts everything necessary for re-building
a specific image:</p>
<p><img alt="Ansible Builder Blog one" src="/images/posts/archive/ansible-builder-blog-one.png"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/quay">Red Hat Quay</a> is a
container image registry that provides storage and enables the building,
distribution, and deployment of containers. Set up an account in quay.io
and select "Create New Repository". A series of choices will be
displayed, starting with what's shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="Ansible Builder blog two" src="/images/posts/archive/ansible-builder-blog-two.png"></p>
<p>From here, you can select your specific GitHub repository (or wherever
you are hosting your image files), then navigate through other settings
such as configuring the build triggers, as well as the specific
Containerfile/Dockerfile and context, amongst other things:</p>
<p><img alt="Ansible builder blog three" src="/images/posts/archive/ansible-builder-blog-three.png"></p>
<p>There are other ways you can also share your Execution Environment
images; the above is just a single example of a streamlined and
easy-to-integrate method.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>We hope you enjoyed learning about Execution Environments and how to
build them using the new Ansible Builder CLI tool!  In a future version
of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, Execution Environments will be
able to be used to run jobs in Ansible Automation Platform, so keep an
eye out for details regarding the next release. For further reading,
please refer to the <a href="https://ansible-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Ansible Builder documentation</a>,
