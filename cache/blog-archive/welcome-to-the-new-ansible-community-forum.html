<h1>Welcome to the new Ansible Community Forum</h1>
<p>Today, we're delighted to announce the launch of the new
<a href="https://forum.ansible.com/">Ansible Community Forum</a> - a single starting point
for questions and help, development discussions, events, and much more.
Everyone is invited, whether you are an Ansible user, contributor or
developer, we are all community! <a href="https://forum.ansible.com/signup?">Register here to join us</a>!</p>
<h2>Hello Discourse!</h2>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the forum's main page:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot" src="/images/posts/archive/forum-main-page-screenshot.png"></p>
<p>For those who are familiar with forums, we hope you'll feel right at
home. For those who may be new, please don't worry! We have a list of
<a href="https://forum.ansible.com/tag/forum-tips">tips &amp; tricks here</a>, and
you're always welcome to check the guides and post in the
<a href="https://forum.ansible.com/c/forum-guide-feedback/">feedback section</a> to help us
shape our online community.</p>
<p>Forums are only successful if they are used. To make that happen, the
Ansible Community Team is looking to make this the real home of the
Ansible Community - a place for users to <a href="https://forum.ansible.com/c/help/6">get help</a>,
to <a href="https://forum.ansible.com/c/events/8">find an event or local meetup</a>,
and a jumping-off point for <a href="https://forum.ansible.com/c/project/7">development and contribution discussions</a>.
That means we need <strong>you</strong> to come and participate! Tell us what you're up to, post your
thoughts or your questions, sign up for an event or two. </p>
<p>The Ansible Community is global, and we are proud to include a section
in the forum aimed at supporting our <a href="https://forum.ansible.com/c/other-languages/10">international communities</a>
who would like to have a space where they can write in their own language. If you
speak any languages other than English, you are welcome to join and
collaborate in your own language. We think this section will be
particularly useful for those who do local meetups, so if you are part
of one, please make use of it to communicate.</p>
<p>This new community space is based on <a href="http://discourse.org/">Discourse</a>,
which is fast becoming the industry standard for web forums - you need
only look to Python, Kubernetes, Fedora, and other open source
communities. It's powerful enough to meet our needs, flexible enough to
deal with the wider variety of projects and teams we have, has solid
accessibility and translations, works well on mobile devices, and (if
you prefer) can be interacted with by email. </p>
<h2>Dive In!</h2>
<p>We in the Ansible Community Team are very excited about this, and we hope you are too.
So <a href="https://forum.ansible.com/signup?">sign up</a>, head to this post to <a href="https://forum.ansible.com/t/introduce-yourself/15/25">introduce yourself</a> and tell us your thoughts. See you there! </p>
