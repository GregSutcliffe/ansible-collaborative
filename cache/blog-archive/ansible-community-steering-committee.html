<h1>Ansible Community Steering Committee</h1>
<p>As we all know, Ansible is a well-adapted tool for the end-to-end
automation of IT infrastructures. At the same time, due to the addition
of new features and developments within the project, the Ansible
community is growing at an accelerated rate. To help structure the
project and also to facilitate the change in direction, we are launching
a <strong>Steering Committee</strong> for the <em>Ansible Community Project</em>.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee's role is to provide guidance, suggestions, and
ensure delivery of the Ansible Community package. The committee shall be
broadly representative of the planning and approval areas.</p>
<p>The initial Steering Committee members, selected based on their wide
knowledge of and active contributions to the Ansible project, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toshio Kuratomi (abadger1999)</li>
<li>Felix Fontein (felixfontein)</li>
<li>Tadej Borovšak (tadeboro)</li>
<li>James Cassell (cyberpear)</li>
<li>John Barker (gundalow)</li>
<li>Andrew Klychkov (andersson007_)</li>
<li>Alicia Cozine (acozine)</li>
<li>Sorin Sbarnea (zbr)</li>
<li>Jill Rouleau (jillr)</li>
<li>Brad Thornton (cidrblock)</li>
<li>Dylan Silva (thaumos)</li>
</ul>
<p>Members of the committee will work with community users plus Ansible
teams within Red Hat to assist in the composition of idea proposals/new
collection inclusion requests. Rather than advocating on behalf of
particular interests or perspectives, the job of the Steering Committee
members is to listen carefully to their fellow community members,
discuss, train, guide, and help them shape the Ansible Upstream Project
in the best possible direction for the community.</p>
<p>Here are the current responsibilities of Ansible Community Steering
Committee members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design policies and procedures for the collection world.</li>
<li>Review content (collections for now) for compliance with the
    policies.</li>
<li>Help create the community deliverables (community.general
    collection, community.network collection, the ansible-tarball,
    community documentation website).</li>
<li>Ballot on approval of new proposals and changes to policies.</li>
<li>Identify and train individuals from the community who are interested
    in contributing to Ansible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Be a catalyst for the Ansible Community</h2>
<p>We encourage all Ansible users to participate in the public Ansible
Community Meeting that occurs weekly in the #ansible-community IRC
channel on libera.chat every
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/community/master/meetings/ical/community.ics">Wednesday at 18:00 UTC</a>. </p>
<p>In addition, we used a GitHub issue -
<a href="https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/539">Community Working Group Meeting Agenda</a> - earlier on to
track agenda topics for discussions in the weekly Ansible Community IRC meetings
Going forward, to track and categorize each topic separately, we've
created a new GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics">community-topics</a>.
To discuss an idea, suggest improvements, or submit new
Policies/Proposals and New Collection Inclusion Requests, you will
create a <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/new">new issue</a>
in the <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics">repo</a> as
a topic, and it'll be discussed publicly in the weekly IRC meeting.
After every meeting, the meeting minutes/summaries and meeting logs will
be posted to the <a href="https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/539">original issue</a>.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee will afford all interested persons an opportunity
to contribute and review, and will also afford all interested persons an
opportunity to speak on any idea during the meeting.</p>
