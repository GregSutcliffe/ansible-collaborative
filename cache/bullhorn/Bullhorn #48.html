<h2>PROPOSALS - FEEDBACK APPRECIATED!</h2>

<p>We are looking for feedback on a new rule for collections included in Ansible on which files are allowed to be used by plugins, roles, and playbooks in this collection. If you maintain a collection that is included in Ansible, please look at <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/70">the corresponding community discussion topic</a> to see how this rule could look like and whether this is a problem for your collection. Thanks!</p>

<p>While most examples should go into the <code>EXAMPLES</code> block in the module documentation, some collections have an <code>examples/</code> directory for more complex ones showing how to combine several modules or roles to achieve something.</p>
<p>Discussion: <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/73">Should there be a standard place for examples?</a></p>

<h3>Chatrooms Feedback</h3>
<p>It is coming up on 6 months since the vote to adopt Matrix alongside IRC. At that time, I said we should treat this as an ongoing process, and I meant it! I am preparing a blogpost covering the adoption so far, data to show, nice wins, pain points, and so on.</p>
<p>I would love to hear from the community about how the last few months have felt for you! Are you a long-term community member, or perhaps someone who just joined? Are the rooms discoverable enough? Are some things causing issues? Good, bad, or just interesting, I'd like to hear it. Note that nothing I hear will be made public without consent - but I hope I can publish some comments, and gain an idea of the sentiment.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable having a direct chat, then message me (<code>@gwmngilfen:ansible.im</code> or <code>gwmngilfen-work</code> on Libera), otherwise please feel free to leave anonymous comments <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/ZDYBFB5">on this form</a>. The feedback window will be open for another 2 weeks, as I plan to write the blogpost in mid-March. Thanks!</p>
