<p><strong>ANSIBLE 3.1.0 RELEASED</strong></p>
<p>The Ansible Community team announced the general availability of Ansible 3.1.0 on March 11th. This update contains bugfixes and new, backwards compatible features in the contained collections. If you would like to learn about how and why we got to version 3.0.0, we invite you to visit our blog for the <a href="https://www.ansible.com/blog/announcing-the-community-ansible-3.0.0-package">background</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.ansible.com/blog/ansible-3.0.0-qa">Q&amp;A</a>. For what's new in the release and how to install it, please see <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/ansible-announce/c/cU4WVtab80o">Toshio Kuratomi's email to the ansible-announce list</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ANSIBLE 4.0.0 ALPHA1 RELEASED</strong></p>
<p>The Ansible Community team announced the first alpha release of Ansible 4.0.0 on March 16th. This update is based on the ansible-core-2.11.x package which is a major update from the Ansible 3.x package (which is based on ansible-base-2.10.x). There may be backwards incompatibilities in the core playbook language. Please see the <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides/porting_guide_4.html">porting guide</a> for details.</p>
<p>This is an alpha release. Therefore, there may be more backwards incompatible changes and new features added before Ansible 4.0.0 final is released. For what is included in this release, and how to get it for testing, please see <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/ansible-devel/c/rtwXoKrIQG0">Toshio Kuratomi's email to the ansible-devel list</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPCOMING ANSIBLE 2.8, ANSIBLE 2.9, ANSIBLE-BASE, ANSIBLE-CORE SCHEDULE</strong></p>
<p>The Ansible Core team shared the plan for Ansible releases prior to 2.10, and the next few ansible-base and ansible-core releases.</p>
<p>On 26 April 2021, several things are slated to happen:
* ansible-core 2.11.0 will see a general availability release
* ansible 2.8.z will be considered End Of Life and will no longer see updates
* ansible 2.9.z will drop to security-only releases</p>
<p>For more detailed dates of specific releases, please take a look at <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/ansible-devel/c/udlVP0236zw">Rick Elrod's email to the ansible-devel mailing list</a>.</p>

<p><strong>ANSIBLE CONTRIBUTOR SUMMIT 2021.03 RECAP AND SURVEY</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/contrib-summit-202103">Ansible Contributor Summit 2021.03</a> was held last Tuesday (March 9, 2021). Here is a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/SGNJZHV">Contributor Survey</a> that we have put together. If you missed the event or want to recap parts from it, the logs, presentations, and recordings are available in the <a href="https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/Contributor-Summit">Ansible Community wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Please take a couple of minutes to fill in the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/SGNJZHV">survey</a>, whether you have attended all/part/none of the event. Feedback is really important to us so we can keep on improving the Contributor Experience for our wonderful Ansible Community.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_wtd">Daniel Schier</a> from the community did a <a href="https://blog.while-true-do.io/ansible-contributor-summit-2021/">great write-up</a> of the event. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>ANSIBLE DOCSITE SPLIT COMPLETED</strong></p>
<p>With the release of Ansible 3, we had a need to track two different releases, Ansible and ansible-core. To achieve this, we now have:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html">Ansible Documentation</a> - This docsite now tracks Ansible (the package).</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/devel/">Ansible Core Documentation</a> - This docsite now tracks ansible-core (and ansible-base).</li>
</ul>
<p>To clarify, <strong>Ansible Documentation</strong> includes everything, with the exception of core porting guides (which are included in the <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/devel/porting_guides/core_porting_guides.html">Ansible core porting guides</a>) and core roadmaps.</p>
<p>The <strong>Ansible Core Documentation</strong> includes only core features. Scenario guides, network guides, and Ansible porting guides/roadmaps are not on ansible-core.</p>

<p>Red Hat is hiring several roles to work on Ansible. Please check the job descriptions in the links and apply!
