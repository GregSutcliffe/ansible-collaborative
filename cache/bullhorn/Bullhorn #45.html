<p>Both ansible-lint and molecule will require python 3.8+ on their next major change, following similar ansible-core move.  Once the pending PRs are merged, the main branches will be py38+ only. We will keep a stable branch for the older versions and backporting.</p>

<p>RFR (please bikeshed the interface) https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint/pull/1828
This PR is the first of a series of PRs that will allow ansible-lint to modify files and not just lint them. Please help me figure out what interface we should use for these features.</p>

<p>Due to reasons explained in https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint/pull/1850 ansible-lint is about to drop support for py36/py37 on its main branch, but we will keep a stable branch for older version. Please review this PR, especially those that already contribute to the project.</p>

<p>Now that CentOS 8 <a href="https://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2020-December/048208.html">has been fully discontinued</a>, most package mirrors have begun culling CentOS 8 content, which breaks all <code>ansible-test</code> CentOS 8 containers configured on discontinued production package mirrors. Rather than rebuilding all versions of the affected containers to use the <code>vault.centos.org</code> package mirrors or moving to a clone distro, we're just discontinuing test container support for CentOS 8. This decision is based largely on the fact that RHEL 8 test VM support via ansible-core-ci is available on all branches to provide nearly identical test coverage.</p>
<p>We recommend that projects immediately remove any <code>centos8/</code> ansible-test container entries in their CI matrices, as they will likely fail on tasks that require access to a package mirror. Projects running their CI under Ansible's Azure Pipelines subscription can replace those CentOS 8 matrix entries with <code>rhel8.2/</code> - <code>rhel8.5/</code> (depending on which version of ansible-test is in use) to get nearly identical coverage under a RHEL 8 VM, provided and paid for by Ansible.</p>
<p>If you want to discuss this, we welcome feedback in <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/news-for-maintainers/discussions/4">ansible-collections/news-for-maintainers/discussions/4</a>.</p>

<h3>FOSDEM Recordings</h3>
<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/">FOSDEM</a> was a blast! I gave a talk recapping the last 6 months of our journey with Ansible and Matrix. There's no surprises here, it's mostly a video version of my blogs from last year, along with some data about how it's going so far, but if you're interested, you can catch the video <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/matrix_ansible/">on the FOSDEM site</a>.</p>
<p>If video is not your thing, then worry not as I also plan to write up a blog post of the situation so far in a month or so - so there'll be a written version for you soon!</p>

<p>If you couldn't make it to FOSDEM, the recording of my talk <code>Simple (but useful) Ansible reporting with ara</code> is now available: https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/ansible_reporting_ara/</p>
<p>I go into why I created the project back in 2016 and how it might be useful to you before doing a live demo where I stand up an instance of AWX and record a job's playbook results with ara.</p>
<p>It was fun and I hope you'll enjoy it too, feel free to reach out if you would like to chat or have any questions!</p>
