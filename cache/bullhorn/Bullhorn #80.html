<p>Summit review time! Speaking as the data person for the Ansible Community Team, Contributor Summit (and AnsibleFest overall) looks to have been quite popular!</p>
<p>Typically we might see ~20-25 unique accounts / day in our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#social:ansible.com">Social room</a> (and the Summit room is obviously very quiet outside of events). However, we saw <em>over 100</em> people in those two rooms during Contributor Summit, and sustained over 50 during the Fest keynotes as well. In total we saw <em>well over 200 unique accounts</em> during the week.</p>
<p>We also saw almost 100 new folks join the Social room over the course of the keynotes (and the rest of the week), for which thanks again to maxamillion and cybette for the keynote and interview shoutouts. We hope you're enjoying it!</p>
<p>As usual, I'll have the survey out shortly, which is open to all the community (whether you attended Summit or not). I look forward to making <em>even more plots</em> for your comsumption üôÇ</p>

<h3>New Meeting: AWX Office Hours</h3>
<p>One of the many benefits of open source projects is the ability to form ‚Äì and collaborate with ‚Äì a community of users and contributors. This mutually benefits the project and the community at large: it helps the project stay pertinent to its users (who can first-hand voice their opinions and concerns) and it helps users to gain insight into the overall direction of the project which makes it easier to know what to expect in the future. All the while, contributors are able to implement features, enhancements, and documentation that they themselves consider important.</p>
<p>This kind of feedback loop is vital to the success of AWX and the AWX team wants to make it as easy as possible for you - our community - to get involved. To that end, we have several things in the works, and would like to begin by announcing our new <strong>AWX Office Hours meeting</strong>.</p>
<p>Our first meeting will be held on <strong>Tuesday, November 8, 2022</strong> at <a href="https://dateful.com/time-zone-converter?t=15:00&amp;tz=UTC">1500 UTC</a> on <a href="https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/13155">Google Meet</a>.</p>
