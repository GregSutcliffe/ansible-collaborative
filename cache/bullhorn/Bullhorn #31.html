</ul>
<p><strong>ANSIBLE COMMUNITY AND MATRIX</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gwmngilfen:ansible.im/">Greg Sutcliffe</a> will be hosting a <a href="https://youtu.be/9R31zq_7R6c">Matrix Q&amp;A</a>, next Tuesday August 3rd at <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Proposal%3A+Ansible+Community+to+accept+Matrix+as+an+equal+partner+to+IRC&amp;iso=20210803T15&amp;p1=136">14:00 UTC</a>, as a way to test out a new method to run our conferences. The video stream will be on <a href="https://youtu.be/9R31zq_7R6c">YouTube</a>, and chat will be held directly in our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#community:ansible.im">IRC/Matrix room</a>, so folks will be able to play back both video and chat later if they wish.</p>
<p><strong>ANSIBLE GALAXY IMPORT CHANGES</strong></p>
<p>Please be aware that there's a change made in Ansible Galaxy to require mandatory <code>requires_ansible</code> in the <code>meta/runtime.yml</code> file for uploading a collection (<a href="https://github.com/ansible/galaxy-importer/pull/122">#122</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ansible/galaxy-importer/pull/124">#124</a>). After you've added the collection, you will probably hit <code>ansible-test</code> failure in sanity checks if you use it with the <code>--venv</code> option, since it is unable to check this field due to the <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75353">failing requirement</a>. You will need to have the <code>meta/runtime.yml</code> file now for your collection to be uploaded.</p>
<p><strong>COLLECTION INCLUSION CANDIDATES FOR ANSIBLE 5.0</strong></p>
<p>We are working towards adding new collections into Ansible 5.0.0, and you can track the progress of the various collections in this <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/32">GitHub issue</a>.</p>
