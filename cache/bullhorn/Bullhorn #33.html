<p><strong>CONTRIBUTOR SUMMIT &amp; ANSIBLEFEST</strong> </p>
<p>The next <a href="https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/contrib-summit-202109">Ansible Contributor Summit</a> will be on September 28th and October 1st, alongside <a href="https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest">AnsibleFest 2021</a>. Registration is open! Please register on <a href="https://ansiblecs202109.eventbrite.com/?aff=bullhorn">Eventbrite</a> to stay informed of updates to the event. Note that the AnsibleFest registration is separate from the Contributor Summit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/contrib-summit-202109#Day-1-Tuesday-September-28-2021">first day (Tuesday, 28/9)</a> is aimed at new contributors and people who want to understand what is involved in contributing. <a href="https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/contrib-summit-202109#Day-2-Friday-October-1-2021">Day two (Friday, 1/10)</a> will contain the usual interactive discussions with more technical details.</p>
<p>In addition, we will be running a <a href="https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/contrib-summit-202109#Hackathon">Hackathon</a> in parallel throughout the week (Tuesday to Friday). This is for anyone with an interest in contributing to Ansible (with a focus on Collections), including those who have never contributed and are unsure of how to get started, existing contributors and maintainers, etc. all are welcome! Resources (people, labs, docs, etc.) will be available to help people through the entire process.</p>
<p>During AnsibleFest, we will have a Community Live Q&amp;A with members of the Ansible Community Team (exact date and time TBD). If you have pressing questions that you'd like us to answer/discuss, please suggest them in this <a href="https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/629">GitHub issue</a>.</p>

<p><strong>ANNOUNCING NEW COLLECTION MAINTAINER</strong></p>
<p>We are happy to announce that the <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/rabbitmq">community.rabbitmq</a> collection has found a new maintainer: <a href="https://github.com/cognifloyd">Jacob Floyd</a>.</p>
<p>He has done an excellent job as a code contributor and reviewer in several repositories within the <code>ansible</code> and <code>ansible-collections</code> organizations. He is also a maintainer of the <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/mongodb">community.mongodb</a> collection.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Ansible Community and the Community Team, weâ€™d like to congratulate him on getting commit access, and say THANK YOU!</p>
<p><strong>ANSIBLE GALAXY UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>We updated the backend infrastructure of <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/">Ansible Galaxy</a> on August 24th. It is now running off the latest major version of OpenShift, and this allows us to keep up to date with performance and security patches.</p>
<p>We realize that we didn't do the best job in informing people about the downtime in advance. We will work on improving such communication, including notification banners on <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/">galaxy.ansible.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ANSIBLE MOLECULE UPDATE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://molecule.readthedocs.io/">Ansible Molecule</a> <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule/discussions/3203">3.4.0</a> was released which now allows plugins to require presence of various collections needed by them. Its most popular plugins were also updated to expose their required collections.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule/discussions/3206">Molecule container</a> was removed from <a href="https://quay.io/">quay.io</a> after almost one year of deprecation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NEW TOOL: RELEASE RSS FEEDS AGGREGATOR</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="https://rss.community.eng.ansible.com/">new tool</a> to help keep track of project releases is now available for the community. It provides a blog-like interface that aggregates the release RSS feeds of relevant Ansible community projects, in addition to every Ansible collection included in the Ansible community package on PyPI. It also provides a meta Atom feed that aggregates the last one hundred events, available <a href="https://rss.community.eng.ansible.com/atom.xml">here</a>. </p>
<p>Feel free to open an issue or pull request in <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/rss-feed-aggregator">rss-feed-aggregator</a> to improve it or add missing projects.</p>
<p><strong>NEW TOOL: CODESEARCH</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="https://codesearch.community.eng.ansible.com/">new Codesearch tool</a> is now available to help quickly search across the 350+ git repositories that make up the <code>ansible</code>, <code>ansible-community</code> and <code>ansible-collections</code> organizations on GitHub, as well as collections included in the Ansible community package.</p>
<p>It is deployed with the help of Ansible. While it is rough around the edges, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/dmsimard/hound-localrepos">take a look here</a> if you are curious about how it works, or perhaps even how you might be able to deploy it for yourself.</p>
