<p>As announced by <a href="https://github.com/GregSutcliffe">Gwmngilfen</a> in <a href="https://mailchi.mp/redhat/the-bullhorn-92">The Bullhorn #92</a>, we started some discussions on the <code>Community strategy 2023</code>. The first result is that the <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/discussions/208">vote</a> to register a DNS zone <code>ansible.community</code> to use for all things relating to Ansible Community has been accepted.</p>
<p>We would love if you would give your opinion on <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/202">using a forum to build project-wide participation &amp; discussion</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/discussions/211">vote</a> on it.</p>
<p>Also, feel free to discuss <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/210">what static site generator we should use for the new Ansible community web presence</a>!</p>

<p>Voting is open for Nikola! The Ansible community team has been gathering feedback and doing some evaluation for static site generators that can help us create a new documentation landing page and community sites. We looked at some really great options and, after some careful considerations, decided that <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> is likely the best SSG to help us get the initial iteration up and running. In community spirit we're putting it to a <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/discussions/216">vote where you can add your +1 / -1 for Nikola</a>.</p>
