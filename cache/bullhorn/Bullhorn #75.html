<h2>GENERAL NEWS UPDATES üîàÔ∏è</h2>

<h3>Room visibility changes on Matrix - rollout complete</h3>
<p>Back in <a href="https://mailchi.mp/redhat/the-bullhorn-63">Issue 63</a> (in June!) we shared the result of the debate on the visibility changes that had been <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/43">voted in by the community</a>, and that we would start a process of rolling that change out to all rooms gradually. I'm glad to say that this is now complete, and all rooms have been updated. So for IRC folks, <strong>the rooms are now public</strong> and ChanServ entrymsgs will direct you to a copy of the history.</p>
<p>We went with a slow rollout of a few rooms per week to allow for feedback. In fact we received very little, mostly in the form of positive reactions to the announcements prior to the change in each room (big thanks to those who gave a üëçÔ∏è). We did also get a few useful comments on the changes, so thanks also to those people for their input (which we acted on).</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who participated in the discussion at various points (both in the debate, and during the rollout) - it's been a long process, but I'm glad it was done the way it was üôè</p>
