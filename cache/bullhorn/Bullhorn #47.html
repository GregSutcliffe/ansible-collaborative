<h2>PROPOSALS - FEEDBACK APPRECIATED!</h2>

<h3>Chatrooms Feedback</h3>
<p>It is coming up on 6 months since the vote to adopt Matrix alongside IRC. At that time, I said we should treat this as an ongoing process, and I meant it! I am preparing a blogpost covering the adoption so far, data to show, nice wins, pain points, and so on.</p>
<p>I would love to hear from the community about how the last few months have felt for you! Are you a long-term community member, or perhaps someone who just joined? Are the rooms discoverable enough? Are some things causing issues? Good, bad, or just interesting, I'd like to hear it. Note that nothing I hear will be made public without consent - but I hope I can publish some comments, and gain an idea of the sentiment.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable having a direct chat, then message me (<code>@gwmngilfen:ansible.im</code> or <code>gwmngilfen-work</code> on Libera), otherwise please feel free to leave anonymous comments <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/ZDYBFB5">on this form</a>. The feedback window will be open for about 2-3 weeks, as I plan to write the blogpost in mid-March. Thanks!</p>

<h3>Improving Ansible documentation by unversioning some guides</h3>
<p>Today, we have multiple files that we only maintain in <code>/devel/</code>. Historically, we had problems keeping these files up to date in other branches (<code>latest</code> and older). The docs team chose to publish the following pages only to <code>devel</code> and put a stub page up in <code>latest</code> and earlier releases to point to <code>devel</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/porting_guides/porting_guides.html">Porting guides</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html">Release and Maintenance</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While this has worked well to keep the relevant docs current, it can be a cause of confusion. One recent reader was confused that we were pointing them to a devel page which has the banner that says this is not a guaranteed stable branch.</p>
<p>We have another set of guides (the community and contributor guides) that are getting a significant overhaul in devel. These guides are not specific to any release (core or Ansible package), but because we publish only to versioned urls, we force these guides to be 'versioned'.</p>
<p>We'd really welcome feedback from users, contributors and folks that have helped with the documentation via <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/68">ansible-community/community-topics#68</a>.</p>

<h3>Revamping the community and contributor documentation</h3>
<p>We have docs in three places today for contributors:
*  ansible/ansible in the <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/docs/docsite/rst/community">community folder</a>
*  <a href="https://github.com/ansible/community-docs">ansible/community-docs</a> - more collection focused
*  <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview">ansible-collections/overview</a> - has deeper collection contribution details</p>
<p>Since only the first one is published to docs.ansible.com, we need to find a way to publish the details from the other two repositories.</p>
<p>This is a complex issue, and will shape how we structure the wide range of Ansible Documentation in the future. We'd really like to get your thoughts, and to hear your ideas via <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/60">community-topics#60</a>.</p>

<h3>Ansible-Core <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">↗</a></h3>
<p>The <code>ansible-core</code> package contains the base engine and a small subset of modules and plugins. To see what's planned for the next release, look at the <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/devel/roadmap/ansible_core_roadmap_index.html"><code>ansible-core</code> roadmaps</a>.</p>

<h3><code>ansible-core</code> is proposing adding Type Annotations</h3>
<p>Since the ansible-core controller fully dropped support for older versions of Python, starting in ansible-core 2.12, new Python language features like inline type annotations have become available to us. Before we open the floodgates to type annotations being splattered across the ansible-core codebase, it's necessary to define some policy around how type annotations will be used, and especially how they will be validated.</p>
<p>If you have experience with Python's type annotations we'd like to hear how you think this could help, let us know your thoughts via <a href="https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/202">ansible/proposals#202</a>.</p>
