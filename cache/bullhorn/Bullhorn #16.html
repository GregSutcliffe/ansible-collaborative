<p><strong>ACCEPTING NEW COLLECTIONS FOR ANSIBLE 3.0.0</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/collection_requirements.rst">criteria for accepting new collections for Ansible 3.0.0</a> (releasing in February) have been approved.</p>
<p>If you would like your collection to be included in ansible-3.0.0, please try to make your collection conform to <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/collection_requirements.rst">the requirements</a> and then <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible-inclusion/discussions/new">submit it as a discussion</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you start the discussion, please include a link to the collection on galaxy, a link to the source code repository, a link to the issue tracker, and the GitHub IDs of collection owners that we should contact if there's a problem with the collection later.</li>
<li>We will review the new collection requests that have been submitted on a first-come, first-served basis. The earlier you submit your collection, the more likely you are to get it into 3.0.0.</li>
<li>The review may turn up things that need to be fixed which would delay acceptance.</li>
<li>2021-01-27 is the date by which new collections <strong>must be reviewed and accepted</strong>, so get your collection in as early as possible! Submitting it close to the deadline may mean that there is not enough time for us to review and approve it resulting in it not being accepted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The procedure for getting new collections in is <strong>highly likely</strong> to change for the Ansible 4.0.0 release (including who reviews, whether it remains first-come first-served, and so forth).</p>
<p><strong>ANSIBLE-BASE 2.10.4 NOW GENERALLY AVAILABLE</strong></p>

<p><strong>ANSIBLE CONTIRBUTOR SURVEY DATA</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gwmngilfen">Greg</a> has started some deep dives into the data from the first 3 Contributor Summit surveys we ran during 2020. He's written up <a href="https://emeraldreverie.org/2020/12/16/community_survey_data_p1/">three</a> <a href="https://emeraldreverie.org/2020/12/16/community_survey_data_p2/">whole</a> <a href="https://emeraldreverie.org/2020/12/16/community_survey_data_p3/">posts</a> on how the survey is designed, and what it has to say about burnout and contribution blockers in Ansible.

<p><strong>DIVERSITY &amp; INCLUSION WORKING GROUP MEETING</strong></p>
<p>The Diversity WG meetings will begin next year on January 7th at 19:00 UTC in IRC channel <code>#ansible-diversity</code>, and take place every other week. Submit agenda items in this <a href="https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/577">GitHub issue</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ANSIBLE DOCUMENTATION SURVEY</strong></p>
<p>We have created a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/B7PDVSB">one-page survey</a> about the Ansible documentation. If you use <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/">docs.ansible.com</a>, we’d love to hear your views! We’re hoping to learn whether different types of users need different types of documentation. We’re also interested in what the most common pain points are for documentation. The survey will be open until December 31st, 2020. Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/B7PDVSB">fill out the survey</a> and pass the word!</p>
