<p>There's a super cool <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ansible-awx">AWX community YouTube channel</a> now. This is a place where we -- the AWX community -- can show off some cool ways to use AWX or share information that the rest of the community might find useful. If you're of the creative type and wish to volunteer to make a video, let's work together and make something cool! Check out <a href="https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/13242">this GitHub issue</a> for information. Make a cool video and get a limited-time angry potato plush!</p>

<p>By popular demand, awx-ee images will soon start having version tags, created when an AWX release happens as a snapshot of the current <code>awx-ee:latest</code> at that point. No more relying on daily builds and a single <code>latest</code> tag! It will be possible to specify a specific, stable image and update to a newer one on your own time! Coming soon!</p>

<p>AWX is working towards moving its Kubernetes deployment from a single deployment to two deployments: one for Task pods and one for Web/API pods. The goal here is to be able to scale these pods independently of each other, which means we need to decouple some service dependencies that we've accumulated over time in the single deployment world. The work here is making steady progress. If anyone is interested in helping out with this or if this will be useful for you, let's chat in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#awx:ansible.com">AWX Matrix channel</a>!</p>
