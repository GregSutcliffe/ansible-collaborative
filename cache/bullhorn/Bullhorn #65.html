<h2>GENERAL NEWS UPDATES üîàÔ∏è</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@orandon:ansible.im">Don Naro</a> shared</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Work continues on improving Ansible documentation for retrievability and general organization.
In this update we're pleased to announce several changes to the User Guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/getting_started/basic_concepts.html">Basic concepts</a> has moved to the <em>Getting started with Ansible</em> section.</li>
<li>All the content for Microsoft Windows users has been separated from the <em>User Guide</em> to a dedicated <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/win_guide/index.html">Using Ansible on Windows</a> guide.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/tips_tricks/index.html">Ansible tips and tricks</a> is also separated from the <em>User Guide</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope these changes help you navigate the Ansible documentation more easily and find the content you're looking for.
More changes to the <em>User Guide</em> are in plan and next up we're aiming to consolidate some of the Playbook content in the User Guide.
You can find out more about this effort, and join in the conversation, in <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78082">GitHub issue 78082</a>.</p>

<h3>Matrix Room Shields for repo READMEs?</h3>
<p>I've opened an <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/pull/114">example PR</a> for displaying a Shields.io shield for a Matrix room inside the README of a repository. This is the same kind of thing as you often see for test coverage, code coverage, Python versions, etc.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/vFQ7VB7.png"></p>
<p>I think this is an useful extra way for maintainers to direct users to the right place to get help, and has the nice side-effect of demonstrating the large vibrant community we have. I'm looking to get feedback on whether this should go in the template repo, so that people know it's an option - what are your thoughts? Please <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/pull/114">comment on the PR</a>!</p>
