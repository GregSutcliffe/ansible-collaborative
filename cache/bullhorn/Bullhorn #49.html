<h2>PROPOSALS - FEEDBACK APPRECIATED!</h2>

<h3>Improving Ansible documentation by unversioning some guides</h3>
<p>Today, we have multiple files that we only maintain in <code>/devel/</code>. Historically, we had problems keeping these files up to date in other branches (<code>latest</code> and older). The docs team chose to publish the following pages only to <code>devel</code> and put a stub page up in <code>latest</code> and earlier releases to point to <code>devel</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/porting_guides/porting_guides.html">Porting guides</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html">Release and Maintenance</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While this has worked well to keep the relevant docs current, it can be a cause of confusion. One recent reader was confused that we were pointing them to a devel page which has the banner that says this is not a guaranteed stable branch.</p>
<p>We have another set of guides (the community and contributor guides) that are getting a significant overhaul in devel. These guides are not specific to any release (core or Ansible package), but because we publish only to versioned urls, we force these guides to be 'versioned'.</p>
<p>We'd really welcome feedback from users, contributors and folks that have helped with the documentation via <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/68">ansible-community/community-topics#68</a>.</p>

<h3>Revamping the community and contributor documentation</h3>
<p>We have docs in three places today for contributors:
*  ansible/ansible in the <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/docs/docsite/rst/community">community folder</a>
*  <a href="https://github.com/ansible/community-docs">ansible/community-docs</a> - more collection focused
*  <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview">ansible-collections/overview</a> - has deeper collection contribution details</p>
<p>Since only the first one is published to docs.ansible.com, we need to find a way to publish the details from the other two repositories.</p>
<p>This is a complex issue, and will shape how we structure the wide range of Ansible Documentation in the future. We'd really like to get your thoughts, and to hear your ideas via <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/60">community-topics#60</a>.</p>

<p>We are looking for feedback on a new rule for collections included in Ansible on which files are allowed to be used by plugins, roles, and playbooks in this collection. If you maintain a collection that is included in Ansible, please look at <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/70">the corresponding community discussion topic</a> to see how this rule could look like and whether this is a problem for your collection. Thanks!</p>

<p>While most examples should go into the <code>EXAMPLES</code> block in the module documentation, some collections have an <code>examples/</code> directory for more complex ones showing how to combine several modules or roles to achieve something.</p>
<p>Discussion: <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/73">Should there be a standard place for examples?</a></p>

<h3>Self-Host a Matrix Map Tile Server</h3>
<p>Following Element's recent announcement of location sharing with support for self-hosted map tile server, I went ahead and set up one, and have written a <a href="https://wrily.foad.me.uk/self-host-a-matrix-map-server">blog post</a> about it, explaining how to go a little further than the currently published guide, and with <a href="https://lab.trax.im/matrix/map-tile-server-ansible">Ansible scripts</a> included.</p>
