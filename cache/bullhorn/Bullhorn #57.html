<blockquote>
<p>Ansible 6.0.0a2 (including ansible-core 2.13.0rc1) is now available for testing! This is a good opportunity to test the upcoming releases of both ansible and ansible-core and report feedback ahead of their releases. See the release announcement for more information: https://groups.google.com/g/ansible-announce/c/GSFkoR0MWpU</p>

<p>Hi o/</p>
<p>We're working on implementing regular testing of ansible-test's sanity checks across every collection included in the Ansible community package and found that many are failing sanity tests. It would be great to fix as many as we can before the release of Ansible 6 around 2022-06-21.</p>
<p>Most failures are not critical and there's a lot of low-hanging fruits that could contribute to improving the quality of the modules and plugins that are released. It's OK to ignore rules that are not relevant but these should be specified in versioned files such as <code>tests/sanity/ignore-2.12.txt</code> in order to avoid warnings and errors.</p>
<p>There's documentation on sanity tests here: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/testing_sanity.html
If you are the maintainer of an included collection or would like to help, you can learn more about the effort and the logs from the sanity tests in this issue: https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/96</p>

<h3>Generic sanity check for all collections</h3>
<p>As https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/issues/114 showed we should really check the existing collections included in the Ansible package. Some ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up some nightly CI that runs some basic sanity checks (like <code>ansible-test sanity --docker -v</code>) on all collections. Let's specify one or two of the stable branches for that.</li>
<li>Give all collections that fail this some time to fix it. If they don't, say, in two months, let's deprecate them with planned removal from Ansible 7. (Doing this for Ansible 6 is too close IMO.)</li>
<li>From then on, warn in advance once new stable branches are added to this CI (and remove old ones so that at most 1-2 of them are active at the same time), with the same rules: if a collection fails CI and doesn't fix it in a certain amount of time (with a new release), they will be deprecated and removed in the next major version of Ansible.</li>
</ol>
<p>What do you think?</p>
