<p>A new collection criteria has been added: Collections are only allowed to use specific directories in the <code>plugins/</code> directory which correspond to <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/collection_requirements.rst#modules-plugins">recognized plugin types</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NEW/UPDATED COMMUNITY COLLECTIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general">Community General Collection</a> community.general 1.3.5 and 2.0.0 have been released. <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/blob/stable-2/CHANGELOG.rst">Changelog for 2.0.0 (with all changes since 1.0.0)</a>.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/docker">Docker Community Collection</a> community.docker 1.2.1 has been released with some improvements and fixes for <code>docker_container</code>, <code>docker_image</code> and the <code>docker</code> connection plugin.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>MODULE COMPAT FOR PYTHON 3.8+ CONTROLLER</strong></p>
<p>If you use Ansible's selinux support in any of the core file modules, or the yum/dnf/apt package managers, we'd love for you to try out <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73423">module compat for py3.8+ controller</a>. As part of the ansible-core 2.11 project to bump controller Python requirements to 3.8+, this pull request provides a couple of new module compatibility APIs, and changes to the core modules that need those APIs to continue functioning under Python 3.8+.</p>
<p>You can pip install the PR to a Python 3.8+ environment from source via <code>pip install https://github.com/nitzmahone/ansible/tarball/module_respawn</code>, or clone the PR locally and run directly from the source in the usual way (assuming you've already got an environment set up to run Ansible from source).</p>
<p>Try out the package management and file module(s) with selinux that you use under <code>localhost</code> with Ansible installed on Python 3.8/3.9, or by forcing <code>ansible_python_interpreter</code> to any target-side supported Python version (2.6-3.9). The modules should now work transparently with no manual installation of dependencies required (including the oft-dreaded <code>libselinux-python</code>!).</p>
<p><strong>REQUEST FOR COMMENTS - KUBERNETES COLLECTION</strong></p>
<p>The Kubernetes inventory plugin is being <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.kubernetes/pull/217">refactored</a> to improve overall operation. We would like your comments on how this plugin is being used. Does the refactoring make sense? What is the impact, if any, of the changes? Are there other improvements to be made to help users? Please add your feedback to this <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.kubernetes/issues/226">GitHub issue</a>.</p>
