<h2>GENERAL NEWS UPDATES</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cybette:ansible.im">cybette</a> contributed</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We published the first issue of <a href="https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/News#the-bullhorn">The Bullhorn</a> - our newsletter for the Ansible developer community - in April 2020. Since then, it has gained momentum and is now one of the main places people go to for Ansible community news, thanks to all of you! We've been releasing them approximately every 2 weeks so far, but with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@newsbot:ansible.im">newsbot</a> streamlining the process and many of you contributing frequently, we are now officially making The Bullhorn a weekly newsletter!</p>
<p>The deadline for submitting news items will be every Thursday at 18:00 UTC. Please send your updates to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@newsbot:ansible.im">newsbot</a> in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#social:ansible.com">Ansible Social room on Matrix</a>. If you're on IRC, you can join the <code>#ansible-social</code> channel on Libera.Chat and mention <code>newsbot[m]</code> with your update, which will achieve the same.</p>

<p>Now that CentOS 8 <a href="https://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2020-December/048208.html">has been fully discontinued</a>, most package mirrors have begun culling CentOS 8 content, which breaks all <code>ansible-test</code> CentOS 8 containers configured on discontinued production package mirrors. Rather than rebuilding all versions of the affected containers to use the <code>vault.centos.org</code> package mirrors or moving to a clone distro, we're just discontinuing test container support for CentOS 8. This decision is based largely on the fact that RHEL 8 test VM support via ansible-core-ci is available on all branches to provide nearly identical test coverage.</p>
<p>We recommend that projects immediately remove any <code>centos8/</code> ansible-test container entries in their CI matrices, as they will likely fail on tasks that require access to a package mirror. Projects running their CI under Ansible's Azure Pipelines subscription can replace those CentOS 8 matrix entries with <code>rhel8.2/</code> - <code>rhel8.5/</code> (depending on which version of ansible-test is in use) to get nearly identical coverage under a RHEL 8 VM, provided and paid for by Ansible.</p>
<p>If you want to discuss this, we welcome feedback in <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/news-for-maintainers/discussions/4">ansible-collections/news-for-maintainers/discussions/4</a>.</p>

<p>We've got two new blog posts from Ashwini Mhatre on <code>Getting Started with Ansible.utils Collection for Playbook Creators</code>. The Ansible <code>ansible.utils</code> collection includes a variety of plugins that aid in the management, manipulation and visibility of data for the Ansible playbook developer. The most common use case for this collection is when you want to work with the complex data structures present in an Ansible playbook, inventory, or returned from modules.</p>
<p>Plugins are code which will augment ansible-core functionality. This code executes on control node and gives options and extensions for the core features of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. This <code>ansible.utils</code> plugin collection includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter plugins</li>
<li>Lookup plugins</li>
<li>Test plugins</li>
<li>Modules</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you'll enjoy <a href="https://www.ansible.com/blog/getting-started-with-ansible.utils-collection-for-playbook-creators-part-1">part1</a> and <a href="https://www.ansible.com/blog/getting-started-with-ansible.utils-collection-for-playbook-creators-part-2">part2</a>, and take a look at the <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible/utils">collection</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.utils">source repo</a> where we'd love to hear your suggestions on how to improve the collection.</p>

<p><em>Changelogs</em> are an important way to let users know about new features, and more importantly potentially backwards incompatible changes which might require you to update how you use a certain Collection. Based on feedback, we've realised that these aren't always written consistently. We are looking for your feedback (especially from end users and maintainers) on how we can give a better experience. We'd love your thoughts via <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/64">community-topics#64</a>.</p>
