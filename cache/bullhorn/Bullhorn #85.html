We will wait for the ansible-core 2.14.2 release, which should happen at the end of January 2023, and will release Ansible 7.2.0 one or two days after that.</p>

<h3>Contacting the Community Team in chat</h3>
<p>The community has changed a lot in the last year - we've said goodbye to some sorely-missed faces, welcomed new faces, and also done some restructuring as well. However, that's left things unclear as to who to reach out to when we're needed. We've had people DM us individually to help with an issue, which we don't mind (it's our job!) but if that person is away, the wider community is left hanging.</p>
<p>To help with this, the Community Team has agreed to add <strong>@mods</strong> to our highlighted words in chat. In <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#real-time-chat">any room we're in</a> (which across the team should be all of them, I think), you can use <strong>@mods</strong>  to get the team's attention, and someone should answer!</p>

<h3>Ansible Edge Collections Update</h3>
<p>At AnsibleFest we announced the work we have been doing for Edge and we wanted to update everyone in The Bullhorn that version 1.0 of <a href="https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra.osbuild">infra.osbuild</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.cip">community.cip</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.fdo">community.fdo</a> collections are available for everyone to start using.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra.osbuild">infra.osbuild</a> collection is designed to set up a builder server to build and host rpm-ostree images so that you have a central repository of your image and updates. Please put in any issues you run into, any and all feedback is greatly appreciated and everyone that worked on this collection can be reached in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#edge:ansible.com">the Ansible Edge matrix room</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.cip">community.cip</a> collection was created in collaboration with Rockwell Automation to configure and audit tags (parameters on the controller that represent inputs and outputs to a device) on programmable logic controllers (PLC) for industrial controls. This enables a manufacturing facility to audit and configure tags on multiple PLCs at scale instead of sending a person with a cable around the factory floor to configure them.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.fdo">community.fdo</a> collection was created by our good friends over at XLAB and was pushed into ansible-collections last Friday by <a href="https://github.com/maxamillion">@maxamillion</a>. This hopefully will make our lives easier when setting up FDO servers and should be used in tandem with infra.osbuild. Please reach out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#edge:ansible.com">the Ansible Edge matrix room</a> with any questions.</p>
