<h3>Matrix Room Shields for repo READMEs?</h3>
<p>I've opened an <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/pull/114">example PR</a> for displaying a Shields.io shield for a Matrix room inside the README of a repository. This is the same kind of thing as you often see for test coverage, code coverage, Python versions, etc.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/vFQ7VB7.png"></p>
<p>I think this is an useful extra way for maintainers to direct users to the right place to get help, and has the nice side-effect of demonstrating the large vibrant community we have. I'm looking to get feedback on whether this should go in the template repo, so that people know it's an option - what are your thoughts? Please <a href="https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/pull/114">comment on the PR</a>!</p>
